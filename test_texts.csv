CRIME AND PUNISHMENT

By Fyodor Dostoevsky



Translated By Constance Garnett




TRANSLATORS PREFACE

A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to
understand his work.

Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hard-working
and deeply religious people but so poor that they lived with their five
children in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings
in reading aloud to their children generally from books of a serious
character.

Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the
final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had
already begun his first work Poor Folk.

This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and
was received with acclamations. The shy unknown youth found himself
instantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career
seemed to open before him but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he
was arrested.

Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist Dostoevsky
was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier
and Proudhon. He was accused of taking part in conversations against
the censorship of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol and of
knowing of the intention to set up a printing press. Under Nicholas
I. (that stern and just man as Maurice Baring calls him) this was
enough and he was condemned to death. After eight months imprisonment
he was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to
be shot. Writing to his brother Mihail Dostoevsky says: They snapped
words over our heads and they made us put on the white shirts worn by
persons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes
to suffer execution. Being the third in the row I concluded I had only
a few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and
I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov who were next to me and to
bid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo we were unbound
brought back upon the scaffold and informed that his Majesty had spared
us our lives. The sentence was commuted to hard labour.

One of the prisoners Grigoryev went mad as soon as he was untied and
never regained his sanity.

The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on
Dostoevskys mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to
accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing
in his own case he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.
He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the
cruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal
servitude spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia where
he began the Dead House and some years of service in a disciplinary
battalion.

He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest
and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy from which he
suffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times
a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was
allowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--Vremya which was
forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost
his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty yet
he took upon himself the payment of his brothers debts. He started
another journal--The Epoch which within a few months was also
prohibited. He was weighed down by debt his brothers family was
dependent on him he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed and is
said never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were
much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.

In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the
monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary
demonstrations of love and honour.

A few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a
vast multitude of mourners who gave the hapless man the funeral of a
king. He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.

In the words of a Russian critic who seeks to explain the feeling
inspired by Dostoevsky: He was one of ourselves a man of our blood and
our bone but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than
we have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart
which we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other
gifts came to him from nature this he won for himself and through it he
became great.





CRIME AND PUNISHMENT




PART I



CHAPTER I

On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of
the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly as though
in hesitation towards K. bridge.

He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His
garret was under the roof of a high five-storied house and was more
like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret
dinners and attendance lived on the floor below and every time
he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen the door of which
invariably stood open. And each time he passed the young man had a
sick frightened feeling which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was
hopelessly in debt to his landlady and was afraid of meeting her.

This was not because he was cowardly and abject quite the contrary; but
for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition
verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in
himself and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting not
only his landlady but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty but the
anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had
given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all
desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror
for him. But to be stopped on the stairs to be forced to listen to her
trivial irrelevant gossip to pestering demands for payment threats
and complaints and to rack his brains for excuses to prevaricate to
lie--no rather than that he would creep down the stairs like a cat and
slip out unseen.

This evening however on coming out into the street he became acutely
aware of his fears.

I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these
trifles he thought with an odd smile. Hm... yes all is in a mans
hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice thats an axiom. It would
be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new
step uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking
too much. Its because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is
that I chatter because I do nothing. Ive learned to chatter this
last month lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the
Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is
_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. Its simply a fantasy to amuse
myself; a plaything! Yes maybe it is a plaything.

The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness the bustle
and the plaster scaffolding bricks and dust all about him and that
special Petersburg stench so familiar to all who are unable to get out
of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young mans already
overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses which
are particularly numerous in that part of the town and the drunken men
whom he met continually although it was a working day completed
the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest
disgust gleamed for a moment in the young mans refined face. He was
by the way exceptionally handsome above the average in height slim
well-built with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank
into deep thought or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness
of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring
to observe it. From time to time he would mutter something from the
habit of talking to himself to which he had just confessed. At these
moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a
tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted
food.

He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would
have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter
of the town however scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have
created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market the number
of establishments of bad character the preponderance of the trading
and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the
heart of Petersburg types so various were to be seen in the streets
that no figure however queer would have caused surprise. But there was
such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young mans heart that
in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth he minded his rags least
of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with
acquaintances or with former fellow students whom indeed he disliked
meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who for some unknown
reason was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy
dray horse suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: Hey there German
hatter bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young
man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall
round hat from Zimmermans but completely worn out rusty with age all
torn and bespattered brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly
fashion. Not shame however but quite another feeling akin to terror
had overtaken him.

I knew it he muttered in confusion I thought so! Thats the worst
of all! Why a stupid thing like this the most trivial detail might
spoil the whole plan. Yes my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd
and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap any
sort of old pancake but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such
a hat it would be noticed a mile off it would be remembered.... What
matters is that people would remember it and that would give them
a clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as
possible.... Trifles trifles are what matter! Why its just such
trifles that always ruin everything....

He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate
of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted
them once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no
faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous
but daring recklessness. Now a month later he had begun to look upon
them differently and in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at
his own impotence and indecision he had involuntarily come to regard
this hideous dream as an exploit to be attempted although he
still did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a
rehearsal of his project and at every step his excitement grew more
and more violent.

With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor he went up to a huge house
which on one side looked on to the canal and on the other into the
street. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by
working people of all kinds--tailors locksmiths cooks Germans of
sorts girls picking up a living as best they could petty clerks etc.
There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the
two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on
the building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them and
at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right and up the
staircase. It was a back staircase dark and narrow but he was familiar
with it already and knew his way and he liked all these surroundings:
in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.

If I am so scared now what would it be if it somehow came to pass that
I were really going to do it? he could not help asking himself as he
reached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters
who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the
flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service and his
family. This German was moving out then and so the fourth floor on this
staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. Thats a good
thing anyway he thought to himself as he rang the bell of the old
womans flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of
tin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells
that ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell and now
its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it
clearly before him.... He started his nerves were terribly overstrained
by now. In a little while the door was opened a tiny crack: the old
woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack and
nothing could be seen but her little eyes glittering in the darkness.
But seeing a number of people on the landing she grew bolder and
opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry which
was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing
him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive
withered up old woman of sixty with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp
little nose. Her colourless somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared
with oil and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck
which looked like a hens leg was knotted some sort of flannel rag
and in spite of the heat there hung flapping on her shoulders a mangy
fur cape yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every
instant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar
expression for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.

Raskolnikov a student I came here a month ago the young man made
haste to mutter with a half bow remembering that he ought to be more
polite.

I remember my good sir I remember quite well your coming here the
old woman said distinctly still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.

And here... I am again on the same errand Raskolnikov continued a
little disconcerted and surprised at the old womans mistrust. Perhaps
she is always like that though only I did not notice it the other
time he thought with an uneasy feeling.

The old woman paused as though hesitating; then stepped on one side
and pointing to the door of the room she said letting her visitor pass
in front of her:

Step in my good sir.

The little room into which the young man walked with yellow paper on
the walls geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows was brightly
lighted up at that moment by the setting sun.

So the sun will shine like this _then_ too! flashed as it were by
chance through Raskolnikovs mind and with a rapid glance he scanned
everything in the room trying as far as possible to notice and
remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The
furniture all very old and of yellow wood consisted of a sofa with
a huge bent wooden back an oval table in front of the sofa a
dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows
chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow
frames representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was
all. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything
was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;
everything shone.

Lizavetas work thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust
to be seen in the whole flat.

Its in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such
cleanliness Raskolnikov thought again and he stole a curious glance
at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room in
which stood the old womans bed and chest of drawers and into which he
had never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.

What do you want? the old woman said severely coming into the room
and as before standing in front of him so as to look him straight in
the face.

Ive brought something to pawn here and he drew out of his pocket
an old-fashioned flat silver watch on the back of which was engraved a
globe; the chain was of steel.

But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day
before yesterday.

I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.

But thats for me to do as I please my good sir to wait or to sell
your pledge at once.

How much will you give me for the watch Alyona Ivanovna?

You come with such trifles my good sir its scarcely worth anything.
I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it
quite new at a jewelers for a rouble and a half.

Give me four roubles for it I shall redeem it it was my fathers. I
shall be getting some money soon.

A rouble and a half and interest in advance if you like!

A rouble and a half! cried the young man.

Please yourself--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The
young man took it and was so angry that he was on the point of going
away; but checked himself at once remembering that there was nowhere
else he could go and that he had had another object also in coming.

Hand it over he said roughly.

The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys and disappeared behind
the curtain into the other room. The young man left standing alone in
the middle of the room listened inquisitively thinking. He could hear
her unlocking the chest of drawers.

It must be the top drawer he reflected. So she carries the keys in
a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And theres
one key there three times as big as all the others with deep notches;
that cant be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some
other chest or strong-box... thats worth knowing. Strong-boxes always
have keys like that... but how degrading it all is.

The old woman came back.

Here sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month so I must take
fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But
for the two roubles I lent you before you owe me now twenty copecks
on the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks
altogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the
watch. Here it is.

What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!

Just so.

The young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the
old woman and was in no hurry to get away as though there was still
something he wanted to say or to do but he did not himself quite know
what.

I may be bringing you something else in a day or two Alyona
Ivanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box as soon as I get it
back from a friend... he broke off in confusion.

Well we will talk about it then sir.

Good-bye--are you always at home alone your sister is not here with
you? He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the
passage.

What business is she of yours my good sir?

Oh nothing particular I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day
Alyona Ivanovna.

Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more
and more intense. As he went down the stairs he even stopped short two
or three times as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was
in the street he cried out Oh God how loathsome it all is! and
can I can I possibly.... No its nonsense its rubbish! he added
resolutely. And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?
What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes filthy above all
disgusting loathsome loathsome!--and for a whole month Ive been....
 But no words no exclamations could express his agitation. The feeling
of intense repulsion which had begun to oppress and torture his heart
while he was on his way to the old woman had by now reached such a
pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to
do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the
pavement like a drunken man regardless of the passers-by and jostling
against them and only came to his senses when he was in the next
street. Looking round he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern
which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.
At that instant two drunken men came out at the door and abusing and
supporting one another they mounted the steps. Without stopping to
think Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had
never been into a tavern but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a
burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer and attributed his
sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little
table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer and eagerly drank
off the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became
clear.

All thats nonsense he said hopefully and there is nothing in it
all to worry about! Its simply physical derangement. Just a glass of
beer a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger
the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew how utterly petty it all
is!

But in spite of this scornful reflection he was by now looking cheerful
as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed
round in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that
moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also
not normal.

There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken
men he had met on the steps a group consisting of about five men and
a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure
left the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern
were a man who appeared to be an artisan drunk but not extremely so
sitting before a pot of beer and his companion a huge stout man with
a grey beard in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had
dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then he began as though in
his sleep cracking his fingers with his arms wide apart and the upper
part of his body bounding about on the bench while he hummed some
meaningless refrain trying to recall some such lines as these:

   His wife a year he fondly loved
    His wife a--a year he--fondly loved.

Or suddenly waking up again:

   Walking along the crowded row
    He met the one he used to know.

But no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with
positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was
another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government
clerk. He was sitting apart now and then sipping from his pot and
looking round at the company. He too appeared to be in some agitation.



CHAPTER II

Raskolnikov was not used to crowds and as we said before he avoided
society of every sort more especially of late. But now all at once he
felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking
place within him and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He
was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy
excitement that he longed to rest if only for a moment in some other
world whatever it might be; and in spite of the filthiness of the
surroundings he was glad now to stay in the tavern.

The master of the establishment was in another room but he frequently
came down some steps into the main room his jaunty tarred boots with
red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his
person. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat
with no cravat and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an
iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen and there was
another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the
counter lay some sliced cucumber some pieces of dried black bread and
some fish chopped up small all smelling very bad. It was insufferably
close and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such
an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.

There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the
first moment before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on
Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him who looked
like a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression
afterwards and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly
at the clerk partly no doubt because the latter was staring
persistently at him obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At
the other persons in the room including the tavern-keeper the clerk
looked as though he were used to their company and weary of it showing
a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and
culture inferior to his own with whom it would be useless for him to
converse. He was a man over fifty bald and grizzled of medium height
and stoutly built. His face bloated from continual drinking was of
a yellow even greenish tinge with swollen eyelids out of which keen
reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very
strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense
feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence but at the
same time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an
old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat with all its buttons missing
except one and that one he had buttoned evidently clinging to this
last trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front covered with spots
and stains protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk he wore
no beard nor moustache but had been so long unshaven that his chin
looked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable
and like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he
ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his
hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky
table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov and said loudly and
resolutely:

May I venture honoured sir to engage you in polite conversation?
Forasmuch as though your exterior would not command respect my
experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not
accustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in
conjunction with genuine sentiments and I am besides a titular
counsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I
make bold to inquire--have you been in the service?

No I am studying answered the young man somewhat surprised at
the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly
addressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for
company of any sort on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his
habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached
or attempted to approach him.

A student then or formerly a student cried the clerk. Just what
I thought! Im a man of experience immense experience sir and he
tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. Youve been a
student or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me....
 He got up staggered took up his jug and glass and sat down beside
the young man facing him a little sideways. He was drunk but spoke
fluently and boldly only occasionally losing the thread of his
sentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as
greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.

Honoured sir he began almost with solemnity poverty is not a vice
thats a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue
and that thats even truer. But beggary honoured sir beggary is a
vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul but
in beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human
society with a stick he is swept out with a broom so as to make it as
humiliating as possible; and quite right too forasmuch as in beggary
I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!
Honoured sir a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating and
my wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me
to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent
a night on a hay barge on the Neva?

No I have not happened to answered Raskolnikov. What do you mean?

Well Ive just come from one and its the fifth night Ive slept
so.... He filled his glass emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in
fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite
probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.
His hands particularly were filthy. They were fat and red with black
nails.

His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The
boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the
upper room apparently on purpose to listen to the funny fellow
 and sat down at a little distance yawning lazily but with dignity.
Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here and he had most
likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of
frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in
the tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards and
especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order
at home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify
themselves and even if possible obtain consideration.

Funny fellow! pronounced the innkeeper. And why dont you work why
arent you at your duty if you are in the service?

Why am I not at my duty honoured sir Marmeladov went on addressing
himself exclusively to Raskolnikov as though it had been he who put
that question to him. Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache
to think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov
beat my wife with his own hands and I lay drunk didnt I suffer?
Excuse me young man has it ever happened to you... hm... well to
petition hopelessly for a loan?

Yes it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?

Hopelessly in the fullest sense when you know beforehand that you
will get nothing by it. You know for instance beforehand with positive
certainty that this man this most reputable and exemplary citizen will
on no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?
For he knows of course that I shant pay it back. From compassion? But
Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day
that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself and that thats
what is done now in England where there is political economy. Why I
ask you should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that
he wont I set off to him and...

Why do you go? put in Raskolnikov.

Well when one has no one nowhere else one can go! For every man must
have somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must
go somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket
then I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport) he added
in parenthesis looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.
No matter sir no matter! he went on hurriedly and with apparent
composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the
innkeeper smiled--No matter I am not confounded by the wagging of
their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already and all
that is secret is made open. And I accept it all not with contempt but
with humility. So be it! So be it! Behold the man! Excuse me young
man can you.... No to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not
_can_ you but _dare_ you looking upon me assert that I am not a pig?

The young man did not answer a word.

Well the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity
after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. Well so be
it I am a pig but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast but
Katerina Ivanovna my spouse is a person of education and an officers
daughter. Granted granted I am a scoundrel but she is a woman of a
noble heart full of sentiments refined by education. And yet... oh
if only she felt for me! Honoured sir honoured sir you know every man
ought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina
Ivanovna though she is magnanimous she is unjust.... And yet although
I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for
I repeat without being ashamed she pulls my hair young man he
declared with redoubled dignity hearing the sniggering again--but my
God if she would but once.... But no no! Its all in vain and its no
use talking! No use talking! For more than once my wish did come true
and more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a
beast by nature!

Rather! assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist
resolutely on the table.

Such is my fate! Do you know sir do you know I have sold her very
stockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the
order of things but her stockings her stockings I have sold for drink!
Her mohair shawl I sold for drink a present to her long ago her own
property not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this
winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three
little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till
night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children for shes
been used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has
a tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I dont feel it?
And the more I drink the more I feel it. Thats why I drink too. I try
to find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer
twice as much! And as though in despair he laid his head down on the
table.

Young man he went on raising his head again in your face I seem to
read some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it and that was why
I addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life I
do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners
who indeed know all about it already but I am looking for a man
of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a
high-class school for the daughters of noblemen and on leaving she
danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for
which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.
The medal... well the medal of course was sold--long ago hm... but the
certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed
it to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms
with the landlady yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past
honours and of the happy days that are gone. I dont condemn her for
it I dont blame her for the one thing left her is recollection of
the past and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes yes she is a lady
of spirit proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has
nothing but black bread to eat but wont allow herself to be treated
with disrespect. Thats why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikovs
rudeness to her and so when he gave her a beating for it she took to
her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was
a widow when I married her with three children one smaller than the
other. She married her first husband an infantry officer for love and
ran away with him from her fathers house. She was exceedingly fond of
her husband; but he gave way to cards got into trouble and with that he
died. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back of
which I have authentic documentary evidence to this day she speaks of
him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad I am glad
that though only in imagination she should think of herself as having
once been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in
a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she
was left in such hopeless poverty that although I have seen many ups
and downs of all sort I dont feel equal to describing it even. Her
relations had all thrown her off. And she was proud too excessively
proud.... And then honoured sir and then I being at the time a
widower with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife offered
her my hand for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can
judge the extremity of her calamities that she a woman of education
and culture and distinguished family should have consented to be my
wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands she
married me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand sir do you
understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No
that you dont understand yet.... And for a whole year I performed
my duties conscientiously and faithfully and did not touch this (he
tapped the jug with his finger) for I have feelings. But even so I
could not please her; and then I lost my place too and that through no
fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch
it!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at
last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent
capital adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a
situation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This
time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come
out.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsels;
and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with I could not say.
There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and
disorder a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by
my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with
from her step-mother whilst she was growing up I wont speak of. For
though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings she is a spirited
lady irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But its no use going over
that! Sonia as you may well fancy has had no education. I did make an
effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal
history but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we
had no suitable books and what books we had... hm anyway we have not
even those now so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at
Cyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity she has read
other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great
interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov Lewes Physiology--do
you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and thats the
whole of her education. And now may I venture to address you honoured
sir on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that
a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen
farthings a day can she earn if she is respectable and has no special
talent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And whats
more Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of
him?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she
made him and drove her roughly away stamping and reviling her on the
pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were
put in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina
Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands her cheeks flushed
red as they always are in that disease: Here you live with us says
she you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.
And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the
little ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well what of
it! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle
creature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale thin
little face). She said: Katerina Ivanovna am I really to do a thing
like that? And Darya Frantsovna a woman of evil character and very
well known to the police had two or three times tried to get at her
through the landlady. And why not? said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer
you are something mighty precious to be so careful of! But dont blame
her dont blame her honoured sir dont blame her! She was not herself
when she spoke but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying
of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything
else.... For thats Katerina Ivanovnas character and when children
cry even from hunger she falls to beating them at once. At six oclock
I saw Sonia get up put on her kerchief and her cape and go out of the
room and about nine oclock she came back. She walked straight up to
Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her
in silence. She did not utter a word she did not even look at her she
simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl
made of _drap de dames_) put it over her head and face and lay down
on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her
body kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there just as before....
And then I saw young man I saw Katerina Ivanovna in the same silence
go up to Sonias little bed; she was on her knees all the evening
kissing Sonias feet and would not get up and then they both fell
asleep in each others arms... together together... yes... and I... lay
drunk.

Marmeladov stopped short as though his voice had failed him. Then he
hurriedly filled his glass drank and cleared his throat.

Since then sir he went on after a brief pause--Since then owing
to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by
evil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a
leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of
respect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take
a yellow ticket and owing to that she is unable to go on living with
us. For our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though
she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...
hm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonias
account. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of
a sudden he stood on his dignity: how said he can a highly educated
man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that? And Katerina
Ivanovna would not let it pass she stood up for her... and so thats
how it happened. And Sonia comes to us now mostly after dark; she
comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room
at the Kapernaumovs the tailors she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is
a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft
palates too. And his wife too has a cleft palate. They all live in one
room but Sonia has her own partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor
people and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning
and put on my rags lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his
excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch do you
know him? No? Well then its a man of God you dont know. He is wax...
wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were
dim when he heard my story. Marmeladov once already you have
deceived my expectations... Ill take you once more on my own
responsibility--thats what he said remember he said and now you
can go. I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only for in reality
he would not have allowed me to do it being a statesman and a man of
modern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home and when I
announced that Id been taken back into the service and should receive a
salary heavens what a to-do there was!...

Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole
party of revellers already drunk came in from the street and the sounds
of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven
singing The Hamlet were heard in the entry. The room was filled with
noise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.
Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.
He appeared by now to be extremely weak but as he became more and more
drunk he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his
recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him and was
positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov
listened attentively.

That was five weeks ago sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna
and Sonia heard of it mercy on us it was as though I stepped into the
kingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast nothing but
abuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe hushing the children. Semyon
Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office he is resting shh!
They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They
began to get real cream for me do you hear that? And how they managed
to get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles fifty
copecks I cant guess. Boots cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent
a uniform they got up all in splendid style for eleven roubles and
a half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina
Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with
horse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any
dresses... none at all but she got herself up as though she were going
on a visit; and not that shed anything to do it with she smartened
herself up with nothing at all shed done her hair nicely put on a
clean collar of some sort cuffs and there she was quite a different
person she was younger and better looking. Sonia my little darling
had only helped with money for the time she said it wont do for me
to come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see. Do
you hear do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you
think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with
our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before she could not
resist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting
whispering together. Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again
now and receiving a salary says she and he went himself to his
excellency and his excellency himself came out to him made all the
others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into
his study. Do you hear do you hear? To be sure says he Semyon
Zaharovitch remembering your past services says he and in spite
of your propensity to that foolish weakness since you promise now and
since moreover weve got on badly without you (do you hear do you
hear;) and so says he I rely now on your word as a gentleman. And
all that let me tell you she has simply made up for herself and not
simply out of wantonness for the sake of bragging; no she believes it
all herself she amuses herself with her own fancies upon my word she
does! And I dont blame her for it no I dont blame her!... Six days
ago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles
forty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: poppet said she
my little poppet. And when we were by ourselves you understand?
You would not think me a beauty you would not think much of me as a
husband would you?... Well she pinched my cheek my little poppet
said she.

Marmeladov broke off tried to smile but suddenly his chin began
to twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern the degraded
appearance of the man the five nights in the hay barge and the pot of
spirits and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered
his listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.
He felt vexed that he had come here.

Honoured sir honoured sir cried Marmeladov recovering himself--Oh
sir perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you as it does to
others and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the
trivial details of my home life but it is not a laughing matter to me.
For I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life
and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would
arrange it all and how I would dress all the children and how I should
give her rest and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour
and restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....
Quite excusable sir. Well then sir (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort
of start raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) well on
the very next day after all those dreams that is to say exactly five
days ago in the evening by a cunning trick like a thief in the night
I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box took out what was
left of my earnings how much it was I have forgotten and now look
at me all of you! Its the fifth day since I left home and they are
looking for me there and its the end of my employment and my uniform
is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the
garments I have on... and its the end of everything!

Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist clenched his teeth closed
his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute
later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and
affectation of bravado he glanced at Raskolnikov laughed and said:

This morning I went to see Sonia I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!
He-he-he!

You dont say she gave it to you? cried one of the new-comers; he
shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.

This very quart was bought with her money Marmeladov declared
addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. Thirty copecks she gave
me with her own hands her last all she had as I saw.... She said
nothing she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth but up
yonder... they grieve over men they weep but they dont blame them
they dont blame them! But it hurts more it hurts more when they dont
blame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now eh? What do
you think my dear sir? For now shes got to keep up her appearance. It
costs money that smartness that special smartness you know? Do you
understand? And theres pomatum too you see she must have things;
petticoats starched ones shoes too real jaunty ones to show off her
foot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand sir do you
understand what all that smartness means? And here I her own father
here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking
it! And I have already drunk it! Come who will have pity on a man like
me eh? Are you sorry for me sir or not? Tell me sir are you sorry
or not? He-he-he!

He would have filled his glass but there was no drink left. The pot was
empty.

What are you to be pitied for? shouted the tavern-keeper who was again
near them.

Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths
came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard
nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged
government clerk.

To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied? Marmeladov suddenly declaimed
standing up with his arm outstretched as though he had been only
waiting for that question.

Why am I to be pitied you say? Yes! theres nothing to pity me for! I
ought to be crucified crucified on a cross not pitied! Crucify me
oh judge crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be
crucified for its not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...
Do you suppose you that sell that this pint of yours has been
sweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it tears and
tribulation and have found it and I have tasted it; but He will pity
us Who has had pity on all men Who has understood all men and all
things He is the One He too is the judge. He will come in that day
and He will ask: Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross
consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is
the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard her earthly father
undismayed by his beastliness? And He will say Come to me! I have
already forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins
which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much.... And he
will forgive my Sonia He will forgive I know it... I felt it in my
heart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive
all the good and the evil the wise and the meek.... And when He has
done with all of them then He will summon us. You too come forth
He will say Come forth ye drunkards come forth ye weak ones come
forth ye children of shame! And we shall all come forth without shame
and shall stand before him. And He will say unto us Ye are swine made
in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also! And the
wise ones and those of understanding will say Oh Lord why dost Thou
receive these men? And He will say This is why I receive them oh ye
wise this is why I receive them oh ye of understanding that not one
of them believed himself to be worthy of this. And He will hold out His
hands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...
and we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and
all will understand Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....
Lord Thy kingdom come! And he sank down on the bench exhausted and
helpless looking at no one apparently oblivious of his surroundings
and plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;
there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard
again.

Thats his notion!

Talked himself silly!

A fine clerk he is!

And so on and so on.

Let us go sir said Marmeladov all at once raising his head and
addressing Raskolnikov--come along with me... Kozels house looking
into the yard. Im going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did.

Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to
help him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech
and leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundred
paces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and
confusion as they drew nearer the house.

Its not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now he muttered in
agitation--and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair
matter! Bother my hair! Thats what I say! Indeed it will be better if
she does begin pulling it thats not what I am afraid of... its her
eyes I am afraid of... yes her eyes... the red on her cheeks too
frightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people
in that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of
the childrens crying too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...
I dont know whats happened! I dont know! But blows I am not afraid
of.... Know sir that such blows are not a pain to me but even an
enjoyment. In fact I cant get on without it.... Its better so. Let
her strike me it relieves her heart... its better so... There is the
house. The house of Kozel the cabinet-maker... a German well-to-do.
Lead the way!

They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase
got darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven oclock
and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night yet it was
quite dark at the top of the stairs.

A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very
poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;
the whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder
littered up with rags of all sorts especially childrens garments.
Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it
probably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs
and a sofa covered with American leather full of holes before which
stood an old deal kitchen-table unpainted and uncovered. At the edge
of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It
appeared that the family had a room to themselves not part of a room
but their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other
rooms or rather cupboards into which Amalia Lippevechsels flat was
divided stood half open and there was shouting uproar and laughter
within. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words
of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.

Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall
slim and graceful woman terribly emaciated with magnificent dark brown
hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down
in her little room pressing her hands against her chest; her lips
were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes
glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And
that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the
candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to
Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for
Marmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.
She seemed to be lost in thought hearing and seeing nothing. The room
was close but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the
staircase but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner
rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in she kept coughing but did not
close the door. The youngest child a girl of six was asleep sitting
curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older
stood crying and shaking in the corner probably he had just had a
beating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old tall and thin
wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung
over her bare shoulders long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.
Her arm as thin as a stick was round her brothers neck. She was
trying to comfort him whispering something to him and doing all she
could to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large
dark eyes which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened
face were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the
door but dropped on his knees in the very doorway pushing Raskolnikov
in front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently
facing him coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what
he had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into
the next room as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no
further notice of him she walked towards the outer door to close it
and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the
doorway.

Ah! she cried out in a frenzy he has come back! The criminal! the
monster!... And where is the money? Whats in your pocket show me! And
your clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the
money! Speak!

And she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently
held up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.

Where is the money? she cried--Mercy on us can he have drunk it all?
There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest! and in a fury
she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov
seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.

And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me but is a
positive con-so-la-tion ho-nou-red sir he called out shaken to and
fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.
The child asleep on the floor woke up and began to cry. The boy in the
corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed
to his sister in violent terror almost in a fit. The eldest girl was
shaking like a leaf.

Hes drunk it! hes drunk it all the poor woman screamed in
despair--and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry hungry!--and
wringing her hands she pointed to the children. Oh accursed life!
And you are you not ashamed?--she pounced all at once upon
Raskolnikov--from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have
been drinking with him too! Go away!

The young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door
was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse
laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust
themselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in
dressing gowns flung open in costumes of unseemly scantiness some of
them with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted when
Marmeladov dragged about by his hair shouted that it was a consolation
to him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill
outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her
way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and
for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her
with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out
Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket to snatch up the
coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to
lay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs he changed
his mind and would have gone back.

What a stupid thing Ive done he thought to himself they have Sonia
and I want it myself. But reflecting that it would be impossible to
take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it he
dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.
Sonia wants pomatum too he said as he walked along the street and he
laughed malignantly--such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia
herself will be bankrupt to-day for there is always a risk hunting
big game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust
to-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine theyve dug
there! And theyre making the most of it! Yes they are making the most
of it! Theyve wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used to
everything the scoundrel!

He sank into thought.

And what if I am wrong he cried suddenly after a moments thought.
What if man is not really a scoundrel man in general I mean the
whole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice simply artificial
terrors and there are no barriers and its all as it should be.



CHAPTER III

He waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had not
refreshed him; he waked up bilious irritable ill-tempered and looked
with hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six
paces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty
yellow paper peeling off the walls and it was so low-pitched that a man
of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment
that he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in
keeping with the room: there were three old chairs rather rickety; a
painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;
the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long
untouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and
half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz but
was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep
on it as he was without undressing without sheets wrapped in his old
students overcoat with his head on one little pillow under which he
heaped up all the linen he had clean and dirty by way of a bolster. A
little table stood in front of the sofa.

It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder but to
Raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.
He had got completely away from everyone like a tortoise in its shell
and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked
sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was
in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated
upon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending
him in meals and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her
though he went without his dinner. Nastasya the cook and only servant
was rather pleased at the lodgers mood and had entirely given up
sweeping and doing his room only once a week or so she would stray into
his room with a broom. She waked him up that day.

Get up why are you asleep? she called to him. Its past nine I have
brought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think youre fairly
starving?

Raskolnikov opened his eyes started and recognised Nastasya.

From the landlady eh? he asked slowly and with a sickly face sitting
up on the sofa.

From the landlady indeed!

She set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and
laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.

Here Nastasya take it please he said fumbling in his pocket (for
he had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--run
and buy me a loaf. And get me a little sausage the cheapest at the
pork-butchers.

The loaf Ill fetch you this very minute but wouldnt you rather have
some cabbage soup instead of sausage? Its capital soup yesterdays. I
saved it for you yesterday but you came in late. Its fine soup.

When the soup had been brought and he had begun upon it Nastasya
sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. She was a country
peasant-woman and a very talkative one.

Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you she
said.

He scowled.

To the police? What does she want?

You dont pay her money and you wont turn out of the room. Thats what
she wants to be sure.

The devil thats the last straw he muttered grinding his teeth
no that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool he added aloud.
Ill go and talk to her to-day.

Fool she is and no mistake just as I am. But why if you are so
clever do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? One
time you used to go out you say to teach children. But why is it you
do nothing now?

I am doing... Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.

What are you doing?

Work...

What sort of work?

I am thinking he answered seriously after a pause.

Nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughter
and when anything amused her she laughed inaudibly quivering and
shaking all over till she felt ill.

And have you made much money by your thinking? she managed to
articulate at last.

One cant go out to give lessons without boots. And Im sick of it.

Dont quarrel with your bread and butter.

They pay so little for lessons. Whats the use of a few coppers? he
answered reluctantly as though replying to his own thought.

And you want to get a fortune all at once?

He looked at her strangely.

Yes I want a fortune he answered firmly after a brief pause.

Dont be in such a hurry you quite frighten me! Shall I get you the
loaf or not?

As you please.

Ah I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out.

A letter? for me! from whom?

I cant say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. Will
you pay me back?

Then bring it to me for Gods sake bring it cried Raskolnikov
greatly excited--good God!

A minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother
from the province of R----. He turned pale when he took it. It was a
long while since he had received a letter but another feeling also
suddenly stabbed his heart.

Nastasya leave me alone for goodness sake; here are your three
copecks but for goodness sake make haste and go!

The letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her
presence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasya
had gone out he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he
gazed intently at the address the small sloping handwriting so dear
and familiar of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.
He delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;
it was a thick heavy letter weighing over two ounces two large sheets
of note paper were covered with very small handwriting.

My dear Rodya wrote his mother--its two months since I last had a
talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me
awake at night thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my
inevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look
to Dounia and I you are our all our one hope our one stay. What a
grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university
some months ago for want of means to keep yourself and that you had
lost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my
hundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent
you four months ago I borrowed as you know on security of my pension
from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is a
kind-hearted man and was a friend of your fathers too. But having given
him the right to receive the pension I had to wait till the debt was
paid off and that is only just done so that Ive been unable to send
you anything all this time. But now thank God I believe I shall
be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate
ourselves on our good fortune now of which I hasten to inform you. In
the first place would you have guessed dear Rodya that your sister
has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be
separated in the future. Thank God her sufferings are over but I will
tell you everything in order so that you may know just how everything
has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When you
wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great
deal to put up with in the Svidrigralovs house when you wrote that
and asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to
you? If I had written the whole truth to you I dare say you would have
thrown up everything and have come to us even if you had to walk all
the way for I know your character and your feelings and you would not
let your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself but what could I
do? And besides I did not know the whole truth myself then. What
made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles
in advance when she took the place as governess in their family on
condition of part of her salary being deducted every month and so it
was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.
This sum (now I can explain it all to you my precious Rodya) she took
chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles which you needed so terribly
then and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then
writing that this money came from Dounias savings but that was not
so and now I tell you all about it because thank God things have
suddenly changed for the better and that you may know how Dounia loves
you and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigalov treated
her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at
table.... But I dont want to go into all those painful details so as
not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short in spite
of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna Mr. Svidrigalovs
wife and all the rest of the household Dounia had a very hard time
especially when Mr. Svidrigalov relapsing into his old regimental
habits was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it
was all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had
conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning but had concealed
it under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and
horrified himself at his own flighty hopes considering his years and
his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.
And possibly too he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide
the truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face
to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal promising her all sorts of
inducements and offering besides to throw up everything and take her
to another estate of his or even abroad. You can imagine all she went
through! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on
account of the money debt but also to spare the feelings of Marfa
Petrovna whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia
would have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would
have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been
inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could
not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know
Dounia of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she
has. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases
she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write
to me about everything for fear of upsetting me although we were
constantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa
Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the
garden and putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position threw
the blame upon her believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful
scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna
went so far as to strike Dounia refused to hear anything and was
shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should
be packed off at once to me in a plain peasants cart into which they
flung all her things her linen and her clothes all pell-mell without
folding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on too
and Dounia insulted and put to shame had to drive with a peasant in an
open cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer
could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and
what could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to
you the truth because you would have been very unhappy mortified
and indignant and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin
yourself and besides Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter
with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow I could not. For a
whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal and it came
to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account
of the contemptuous looks whispers and even remarks made aloud about
us. All our acquaintances avoided us nobody even bowed to us in the
street and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to
insult us in a shameful way smearing the gates of our house with pitch
so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set
going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at
her in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood and that
month she was continually coming into the town and as she is
rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and
particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not
at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in
the town but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill but
Dounia bore it better than I did and if only you could have seen how
she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is
an angel! But by Gods mercy our sufferings were cut short: Mr.
Svidrigalov returned to his senses and repented and probably
feeling sorry for Dounia he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and
unmistakable proof of Dounias innocence in the form of a letter Dounia
had been forced to write and give to him before Marfa Petrovna
came upon them in the garden. This letter which remained in Mr.
Svidrigalovs hands after her departure she had written to refuse
personal explanations and secret interviews for which he was entreating
her. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation
for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna reminding
him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how
infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl
unhappy enough already. Indeed dear Rodya the letter was so nobly and
touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot
read it without tears. Moreover the evidence of the servants too
cleared Dounias reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more
than Mr. Svidrigalov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case
with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback and again
crushed as she said herself to us but she was completely convinced of
Dounias innocence. The very next day being Sunday she went straight
to the Cathedral knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give
her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she
came straight from the Cathedral to us told us the whole story wept
bitterly and fully penitent she embraced Dounia and besought her to
forgive her. The same morning without any delay she went round to all
the houses in the town and everywhere shedding tears she asserted in
the most flattering terms Dounias innocence and the nobility of
her feelings and her behavior. What was more she showed and read to
everyone the letter in Dounias own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigalov and
even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was
superfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about
the whole town because some people had taken offence through precedence
having been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns so
that in every house she was expected before she arrived and everyone
knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the
letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading
of it even many who had heard it several times already both in their
own houses and in other peoples. In my opinion a great deal a very
great deal of all this was unnecessary; but thats Marfa Petrovnas
character. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounias
reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible
disgrace upon her husband as the only person to blame so that I really
began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too
harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families
but she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked
respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which one may
say our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know dear Rodya
that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry
him. I hasten to tell you all about the matter and though it has been
arranged without asking your consent I think you will not be aggrieved
with me or with your sister on that account for you will see that we
could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you
could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This
was how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor Pyotr
Petrovitch Luzhin and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna who
has been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his
expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was
properly received drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent
us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a
speedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry
to get to Petersburg so that every moment is precious to him. At first
of course we were greatly surprised as it had all happened so quickly
and unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a
well-to-do man to be depended upon he has two posts in the government
and has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years
old but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be
thought attractive by women and he is altogether a very respectable and
presentable man only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.
But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.
And beware dear Rodya when he comes to Petersburg as he shortly will
do beware of judging him too hastily and severely as your way is if
there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this
warning although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression
upon you. Moreover in order to understand any man one must be
deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas
which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr
Petrovitch judging by many indications is a thoroughly estimable man.
At his first visit indeed he told us that he was a practical man but
still he shares as he expressed it many of the convictions of our
most rising generation and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He
said a good deal more for he seems a little conceited and likes to be
listened to but this is scarcely a vice. I of course understood very
little of it but Dounia explained to me that though he is not a man
of great education he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know
your sisters character Rodya. She is a resolute sensible patient and
generous girl but she has a passionate heart as I know very well.
Of course there is no great love either on his side or on hers but
Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel and will make
it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her
happiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt though it
must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he
is a man of great prudence and he will see to be sure of himself that
his own happiness will be the more secure the happier Dounia is with
him. And as for some defects of character for some habits and even
certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in
the happiest marriages--Dounia has said that as regards all that she
relies on herself that there is nothing to be uneasy about and
that she is ready to put up with a great deal if only their future
relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me
for instance at first as rather abrupt but that may well come
from his being an outspoken man and that is no doubt how it is. For
instance at his second visit after he had received Dounias consent
in the course of conversation he declared that before making
Dounias acquaintance he had made up his mind to marry a girl of
good reputation without dowry and above all one who had experienced
poverty because as he explained a man ought not to be indebted to his
wife but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her
benefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely
than I have done for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only
remember the meaning. And besides it was obviously not said of design
but slipped out in the heat of conversation so that he tried afterwards
to correct himself and smooth it over but all the same it did strike
me as somewhat rude and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was
vexed and answered that words are not deeds and that of course is
perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up
her mind and thinking that I was asleep she got out of bed and was
walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before
the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me
that she had decided.

I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for
Petersburg where he has a great deal of business and he wants to open
a legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil
and commercial litigation and only the other day he won an important
case. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before
the Senate. So Rodya dear he may be of the greatest use to you in
every way indeed and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day
you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that
your future is marked out and assured for you. Oh if only this comes to
pass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a
providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even
ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.
He was cautious in his answer and said that of course as he could not
get on without a secretary it would be better to be paying a salary to
a relation than to a stranger if only the former were fitted for the
duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then
he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave
you time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time but
Dounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever
for the last few days and has already made a regular plan for
your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr
Petrovitchs business which might well be seeing that you are a
student of law. I am in complete agreement with her Rodya and share
all her plans and hopes and think there is every probability of
realising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitchs evasiveness very
natural at present (since he does not know you) Dounia is firmly
persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her
future husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful
not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch
especially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might
take this very coldly it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor
has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have
of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken
of it in the first place because it will come to pass of itself
later on and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of
himself (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since
you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office and
receive this assistance not as a charity but as a salary earned by your
own work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree
with her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason that
is because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when
you first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about
you he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing
him close for oneself and that he looked forward to forming his own
opinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know my precious
Rodya I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr
Petrovitch though simply for my own personal perhaps old-womanish
fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself apart than with
them after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and
delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter
for the future and if he has said nothing about it hitherto it is
simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have
noticed more than once in my life that husbands dont quite get on with
their mothers-in-law and I dont want to be the least bit in anyones
way and for my own sake too would rather be quite independent so
long as I have a crust of bread of my own and such children as you and
Dounia. If possible I would settle somewhere near you for the most
joyful piece of news dear Rodya I have kept for the end of my letter:
know then my dear boy that we may perhaps be all together in a
very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of
almost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to
set off for Petersburg exactly when I dont know but very very soon
possibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us
know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his
own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible
even before the fast of Our Lady if it could be managed or if that is
too soon to be ready immediately after. Oh with what happiness I shall
press you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought
of seeing you she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry
Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing
anything to you now and has only told me to write that she has so much
so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now for
a few lines would tell you nothing and it would only mean upsetting
herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But
although we shall be meeting so soon perhaps I shall send you as much
money as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia
is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch my credit has suddenly improved and I know
that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles
on the security of my pension so that perhaps I shall be able to send
you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more but I am
uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has
been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey that
is to say he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big
trunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his) we
must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg where we
cant be left without a halfpenny at least for the first few days. But
we have calculated it all Dounia and I to the last penny and we see
that the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from
us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we
know so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel
quite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send
to you not twenty-five but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered
two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole
history but so many events have happened! And now my precious Rodya
I embrace you and send you a mothers blessing till we meet. Love Dounia
your sister Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she
loves you beyond everything more than herself. She is an angel and you
Rodya you are everything to us--our one hope our one consolation. If
only you are happy we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers
Rodya and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I am
afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of
infidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so I pray for you. Remember
dear boy how in your childhood when your father was living you used
to lisp your prayers at my knee and how happy we all were in those
days. Good-bye till we meet then--I embrace you warmly warmly with
many kisses.

Yours till death

PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.


Almost from the first while he read the letter Raskolnikovs face was
wet with tears; but when he finished it his face was pale and distorted
and a bitter wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid his
head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered pondered a long
time. His heart was beating violently and his brain was in a turmoil.
At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was
like a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. He
took up his hat and went out this time without dread of meeting
anyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of the
Vassilyevsky Ostrov walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect as though
hastening on some business but he walked as his habit was without
noticing his way muttering and even speaking aloud to himself to the
astonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.



CHAPTER IV

His mothers letter had been a torture to him but as regards the chief
fact in it he had felt not one moments hesitation even whilst he was
reading the letter. The essential question was settled and irrevocably
settled in his mind: Never such a marriage while I am alive and
Mr. Luzhin be damned! The thing is perfectly clear he muttered
to himself with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his
decision. No mother no Dounia you wont deceive me! and then they
apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without
me! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and cant be broken
off; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:
Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in
post-haste almost by express. No Dounia I see it all and I know what
you want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about when
you walked up and down all night and what your prayers were like before
the Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mothers bedroom. Bitter is
the ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you have
determined to marry a sensible business man Avdotya Romanovna one
who has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune that is so much
more solid and impressive) a man who holds two government posts and who
shares the ideas of our most rising generation as mother writes and
who _seems_ to be kind as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beats
everything! And that very Dounia for that very _seems_ is marrying
him! Splendid! splendid!

... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about our
most rising generation? Simply as a descriptive touch or with the idea
of prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh the cunning of them!
I should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one
another that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into
_words_ or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart
and in their minds so that there was no need to speak of it aloud and
better not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that from
mothers letter its evident: he struck her as rude _a little_ and
mother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was
sure to be vexed and answered her angrily. I should think so! Who
would not be angered when it was quite clear without any nave questions
and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And why
does she write to me love Dounia Rodya and she loves you more than
herself? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter
to her son? You are our one comfort you are everything to us. Oh
mother!

His bitterness grew more and more intense and if he had happened to
meet Mr. Luzhin at the moment he might have murdered him.

Hm... yes thats true he continued pursuing the whirling ideas that
chased each other in his brain it is true that it needs time and care
to get to know a man but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The
chief thing is he is a man of business and _seems_ kind that was
something wasnt it to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man
no doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a
peasants cart covered with sacking (I know I have been driven in
it). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can travel very
comfortably third class for a thousand versts! Quite right too. One
must cut ones coat according to ones cloth but what about you Mr.
Luzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has
to raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure its a matter
of business a partnership for mutual benefit with equal shares and
expenses;--food and drink provided but pay for your tobacco. The
business man has got the better of them too. The luggage will cost less
than their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they
dont both see all that or is it that they dont want to see? And
they are pleased pleased! And to think that this is only the first
blossoming and that the real fruits are to come! But what really
matters is not the stinginess is not the meanness but the _tone_
of the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage its a
foretaste of it. And mother too why should she be so lavish? What will
she have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or
two paper ones as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What does
she expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasons
already for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the
marriage even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt let
slip something on that subject also though mother would deny it: I
shall refuse says she. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she counting
on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when
Afanasy Ivanovitchs debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls and
embroiders cuffs ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls dont add
more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty I know
that. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhins
generosity; he will offer it of himself he will press it on me.
You may wait a long time for that! Thats how it always is with these
Schilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan
with them till the last moment they hope for the best and will see
nothing wrong and although they have an inkling of the other side of
the picture yet they wont face the truth till they are forced to; the
very thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with
both hands until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fools
cap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin
has any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and
that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.
He will be sure to have it for his wedding too! Enough of him confound
him!

Well... mother I dont wonder at its like her God bless her but
how could Dounia? Dounia darling as though I did not know you! You were
nearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writes
that Dounia can put up with a great deal. I know that very well. I
knew that two years and a half ago and for the last two and a half
years I have been thinking about it thinking of just that that Dounia
can put up with a great deal. If she could put up with Mr. Svidrigalov
and all the rest of it she certainly can put up with a great deal. And
now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up
with Mr. Luzhin who propounds the theory of the superiority of
wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husbands
bounty--who propounds it too almost at the first interview. Granted
that he let it slip though he is a sensible man (yet maybe it
was not a slip at all but he meant to make himself clear as soon as
possible) but Dounia Dounia? She understands the man of course but
she will have to live with the man. Why! shed live on black bread
and water she would not sell her soul she would not barter her moral
freedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein
much less Mr. Luzhins money. No Dounia was not that sort when I knew
her and... she is still the same of course! Yes theres no denying
the Svidrigalovs are a bitter pill! Its a bitter thing to spend ones
life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles but I know
she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German
master than degrade her soul and her moral dignity by binding herself
for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has
nothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been of
unalloyed gold or one huge diamond she would never have consented to
become his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? Whats the
point of it? Whats the answer? Its clear enough: for herself for her
comfort to save her life she would not sell herself but for someone
else she is doing it! For one she loves for one she adores she will
sell herself! Thats what it all amounts to; for her brother for her
mother she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases
we overcome our moral feeling if necessary freedom peace conscience
even all all are brought into the market. Let my life go if only my
dear ones may be happy! More than that we become casuists we learn
to be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves we can
persuade ourselves that it is ones duty for a good object. Thats just
like us its as clear as daylight. Its clear that Rodion Romanovitch
Raskolnikov is the central figure in the business and no one else. Oh
yes she can ensure his happiness keep him in the university make him
a partner in the office make his whole future secure; perhaps he may
even be a rich man later on prosperous respected and may even end his
life a famous man! But my mother? Its all Rodya precious Rodya her
first born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh
loving over-partial hearts! Why for his sake we would not shrink even
from Sonias fate. Sonia Sonia Marmeladov the eternal victim so long
as the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice both
of you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in
it? And let me tell you Dounia Sonias life is no worse than life with
Mr. Luzhin. There can be no question of love mother writes. And what
if there can be no respect either if on the contrary there is aversion
contempt repulsion what then? So you will have to keep up your
appearance too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartness
means? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same
thing as Sonias and may be worse viler baser because in your case
Dounia its a bargain for luxuries after all but with Sonia its
simply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for it has to be
paid for Dounia this smartness. And what if its more than you can
bear afterwards if you regret it? The bitterness the misery the
curses the tears hidden from all the world for you are not a Marfa
Petrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy
she is worried but then when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes
indeed what have you taken me for? I wont have your sacrifice Dounia
I wont have it mother! It shall not be so long as I am alive it
shall not it shall not! I wont accept it!

He suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.

It shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it? Youll
forbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on your
side to give you such a right? Your whole life your whole future you
will devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained a
post_? Yes we have heard all that before and thats all _words_ but
now? Now something must be done now do you understand that? And
what are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on their
hundred roubles pension. They borrow from the Svidrigalovs. How are
you going to save them from Svidrigalovs from Afanasy Ivanovitch
Vahrushin oh future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for
them? In another ten years? In another ten years mother will be blind
with knitting shawls maybe with weeping too. She will be worn to a
shadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for a moment what may have
become of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her during those
ten years? Can you fancy?

So he tortured himself fretting himself with such questions and
finding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all these questions were not
new ones suddenly confronting him they were old familiar aches. It was
long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. Long long
ago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and
gathered strength it had matured and concentrated until it had taken
the form of a fearful frenzied and fantastic question which tortured
his heart and mind clamouring insistently for an answer. Now his
mothers letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was clear
that he must not now suffer passively worrying himself over unsolved
questions but that he must do something do it at once and do it
quickly. Anyway he must decide on something or else...

Or throw up life altogether! he cried suddenly in a frenzy--accept
ones lot humbly as it is once for all and stifle everything in
oneself giving up all claim to activity life and love!

Do you understand sir do you understand what it means when you have
absolutely nowhere to turn? Marmeladovs question came suddenly into
his mind for every man must have somewhere to turn....

He gave a sudden start; another thought that he had had yesterday
slipped back into his mind. But he did not start at the thought
recurring to him for he knew he had _felt beforehand_ that it must
come back he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterdays
thought. The difference was that a month ago yesterday even the
thought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all
it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape and he suddenly
became aware of this himself.... He felt a hammering in his head and
there was a darkness before his eyes.

He looked round hurriedly he was searching for something. He wanted
to sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----
Boulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. He
walked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little
adventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat he had
noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him but at first
he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his
path. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the
road by which he was going and he was accustomed to walk like that. But
there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front
of him that gradually his attention was riveted upon her at first
reluctantly and as it were resentfully and then more and more
intently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so
strange about the woman. In the first place she appeared to be a girl
quite young and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with
no parasol or gloves waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had
on a dress of some light silky material but put on strangely awry not
properly hooked up and torn open at the top of the skirt close to the
waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was
flung about her bare throat but lay slanting on one side. The girl was
walking unsteadily too stumbling and staggering from side to side. She
drew Raskolnikovs whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the
seat but on reaching it she dropped down on it in the corner;
she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes
apparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely he saw at once
that she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He
could hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the
face of a quite young fair-haired girl--sixteen perhaps not more than
fifteen years old pretty little face but flushed and heavy looking
and as it were swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was
doing; she crossed one leg over the other lifting it indecorously and
showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.

Raskolnikov did not sit down but he felt unwilling to leave her
and stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never much
frequented; and now at two oclock in the stifling heat it was quite
deserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard about fifteen
paces away a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He
too would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object
of his own. He too had probably seen her in the distance and had
followed her but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily at
him though he tried to escape his notice and stood impatiently biding
his time till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His
intentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump thickly-set
man about thirty fashionably dressed with a high colour red lips and
moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult
this fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walked
towards the gentleman.

Hey! You Svidrigalov! What do you want here? he shouted clenching
his fists and laughing spluttering with rage.

What do you mean? the gentleman asked sternly scowling in haughty
astonishment.

Get away thats what I mean.

How dare you you low fellow!

He raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists without
reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like
himself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind and a
police constable stood between them.

Thats enough gentlemen no fighting please in a public place. What
do you want? Who are you? he asked Raskolnikov sternly noticing his
rags.

Raskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward sensible
soldierly face with grey moustaches and whiskers.

You are just the man I want Raskolnikov cried catching at his arm.
I am a student Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too he
added addressing the gentleman come along I have something to show
you.

And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.

Look here hopelessly drunk and she has just come down the boulevard.
There is no telling who and what she is she does not look like a
professional. Its more likely she has been given drink and deceived
somewhere... for the first time... you understand? and theyve put her
out into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn and
the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody she has
not dressed herself and dressed by unpractised hands by a mans hands;
thats evident. And now look there: I dont know that dandy with whom I
was going to fight I see him for the first time but he too has seen
her on the road just now drunk not knowing what she is doing and now
he is very eager to get hold of her to get her away somewhere while she
is in this state... thats certain believe me I am not wrong. I saw
him myself watching her and following her but I prevented him and he
is just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little and
is standing still pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we
keep her out of his hands and how are we to get her home?

The policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to
understand he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to
examine her more closely and his face worked with genuine compassion.

Ah what a pity! he said shaking his head--why she is quite a
child! She has been deceived you can see that at once. Listen lady
 he began addressing her where do you live? The girl opened her weary
and sleepy-looking eyes gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her
hand.

Here said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty
copecks here call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. The
only thing is to find out her address!

Missy missy! the policeman began again taking the money. Ill fetch
you a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you eh? Where do
you live?

Go away! They wont let me alone the girl muttered and once more
waved her hand.

Ach ach how shocking! Its shameful missy its a shame! He shook
his head again shocked sympathetic and indignant.

Its a difficult job the policeman said to Raskolnikov and as he
did so he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He too must have
seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!

Did you meet her far from here? he asked him.

I tell you she was walking in front of me staggering just here in
the boulevard. She only just reached the seat and sank down on it.

Ah the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays God have
mercy on us! An innocent creature like that drunk already! She has been
deceived thats a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....
Ah the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to
gentlefolk too poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.
She looks refined too as though she were a lady and he bent over her
once more.

Perhaps he had daughters growing up like that looking like ladies and
refined with pretensions to gentility and smartness....

The chief thing is Raskolnikov persisted to keep her out of this
scoundrels hands! Why should he outrage her! Its as clear as day what
he is after; ah the brute he is not moving off!

Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him
and seemed about to fly into a rage again but thought better of it and
confined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly another
ten paces away and again halted.

Keep her out of his hands we can said the constable thoughtfully
if only shed tell us where to take her but as it is.... Missy hey
missy! he bent over her once more.

She opened her eyes fully all of a sudden looked at him intently as
though realising something got up from the seat and walked away in the
direction from which she had come. Oh shameful wretches they wont let
me alone! she said waving her hand again. She walked quickly though
staggering as before. The dandy followed her but along another avenue
keeping his eye on her.

Dont be anxious I wont let him have her the policeman said
resolutely and he set off after them.

Ah the vice one sees nowadays! he repeated aloud sighing.

At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a
complete revulsion of feeling came over him.

Hey here! he shouted after the policeman.

The latter turned round.

Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuse
himself. He pointed at the dandy What is it to do with you?

The policeman was bewildered and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikov
laughed.

Well! ejaculated the policeman with a gesture of contempt and he
walked after the dandy and the girl probably taking Raskolnikov for a
madman or something even worse.

He has carried off my twenty copecks Raskolnikov murmured angrily
when he was left alone. Well let him take as much from the other
fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did I
want to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Let
them devour each other alive--what is to me? How did I dare to give him
twenty copecks? Were they mine?

In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on
the deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hard
to fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself
altogether to forget everything and then to wake up and begin life
anew....

Poor girl! he said looking at the empty corner where she had
sat--She will come to herself and weep and then her mother will find
out.... She will give her a beating a horrible shameful beating and
then maybe turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not the
Darya Frantsovnas will get wind of it and the girl will soon be
slipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospital
directly (thats always the luck of those girls with respectable
mothers who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...
drink... the taverns... and more hospital in two or three years--a
wreck and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seen
cases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why theyve all
come to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? Thats as it should
be they tell us. A certain percentage they tell us must every year
go... that way... to the devil I suppose so that the rest may remain
chaste and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words
they have; they are so scientific so consolatory.... Once youve said
percentage theres nothing more to worry about. If we had any other
word... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were one
of the percentage! Of another one if not that one?

But where am I going? he thought suddenly. Strange I came out for
something. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was going
to Vassilyevsky Ostrov to Razumihin. Thats what it was... now I
remember. What for though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin
into my head just now? Thats curious.

He wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the
university. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at
the university; he kept aloof from everyone went to see no one and did
not welcome anyone who came to see him and indeed everyone soon gave
him up. He took no part in the students gatherings amusements or
conversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself
and he was respected for this but no one liked him. He was very poor
and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him as though
he were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades
to look down upon them all as children as though he were superior in
development knowledge and convictions as though their beliefs and
interests were beneath him.

With Razumihin he had got on or at least he was more unreserved and
communicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other
terms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid
youth good-natured to the point of simplicity though both depth and
dignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades
understood this and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent
though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking
appearance--tall thin blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was
sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.
One night when out in a festive company he had with one blow laid
a gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking
powers but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went
too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.
Another thing striking about Razumihin no failure distressed him and
it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He
could lodge anywhere and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was
very poor and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of
one sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn
money. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove and used to
declare that he liked it better because one slept more soundly in
the cold. For the present he too had been obliged to give up the
university but it was only for a time and he was working with all his
might to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had
not been to see him for the last four months and Razumihin did not even
know his address. About two months before they had met in the street
but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that
he might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him he passed
him by as he did not want to annoy him.



CHAPTER V

Of course Ive been meaning lately to go to Razumihins to ask for
work to ask him to get me lessons or something... Raskolnikov thought
but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons suppose
he shares his last farthing with me if he has any farthings so that
I could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...
hm... Well and what then? What shall I do with the few coppers I
earn? Thats not what I want now. Its really absurd for me to go to
Razumihin....

The question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more
than he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister
significance in this apparently ordinary action.

Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by
means of Razumihin alone? he asked himself in perplexity.

He pondered and rubbed his forehead and strange to say after long
musing suddenly as if it were spontaneously and by chance a fantastic
thought came into his head.

Hm... to Razumihins he said all at once calmly as though he had
reached a final determination. I shall go to Razumihins of course
but... not now. I shall go to him... on the next day after It when It
will be over and everything will begin afresh....

And suddenly he realised what he was thinking.

After It he shouted jumping up from the seat but is It really
going to happen? Is it possible it really will happen? He left the
seat and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back homewards
but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;
in that hole in that awful little cupboard of his all _this_ had for a
month past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.

His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel
shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he
began almost unconsciously from some inner craving to stare at all
the objects before him as though looking for something to distract his
attention; but he did not succeed and kept dropping every moment into
brooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round
he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he
was going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov came
out on to the Lesser Neva crossed the bridge and turned towards the
islands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary
eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in
and weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns no stifling closeness
no stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid
irritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer
villa standing among green foliage he gazed through the fence he saw
in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies
and children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his
attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met too by
luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them
with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from
his sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had
thirty copecks. Twenty to the policeman three to Nastasya for the
letter so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs
yesterday he thought reckoning it up for some unknown reason but he
soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.
He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern and felt that he
was hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a
pie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long
while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once
though he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and
a great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards but reaching
Petrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted turned off the road
into the bushes sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.

In a morbid condition of the brain dreams often have a singular
actuality vividness and extraordinary semblance of reality. At times
monstrous images are created but the setting and the whole picture are
so truth-like and filled with details so delicate so unexpectedly but
so artistically consistent that the dreamer were he an artist like
Pushkin or Turgenev even could never have invented them in the waking
state. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a
powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.

Raskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhood
in the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old
walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It
was a grey and heavy day the country was exactly as he remembered it;
indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in
memory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand not
even a willow near it; only in the far distance a copse lay a dark
blur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market
garden stood a tavern a big tavern which had always aroused in him a
feeling of aversion even of fear when he walked by it with his father.
There was always a crowd there always shouting laughter and abuse
hideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking
figures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his
father trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road
became a dusty track the dust of which was always black. It was a
winding road and about a hundred paces further on it turned to the
right to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone
church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three
times a year with his father and mother when a service was held in
memory of his grandmother who had long been dead and whom he had never
seen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a
table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in
the shape of a cross. He loved that church the old-fashioned unadorned
ikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmothers
grave which was marked by a stone was the little grave of his younger
brother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all
but he had been told about his little brother and whenever he visited
the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and
to bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was
walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he
was holding his fathers hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A
peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be
some kind of festivity going on there were crowds of gaily dressed
townspeople peasant women their husbands and riff-raff of all sorts
all singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern
stood a cart but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually
drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy
goods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses with their
long manes thick legs and slow even pace drawing along a perfect
mountain with no appearance of effort as though it were easier going
with a load than without it. But now strange to say in the shafts of
such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast one of those peasants
nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load
of wood or hay especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in
a rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly sometimes even
about the nose and eyes and he felt so sorry so sorry for them that
he almost cried and his mother always used to take him away from the
window. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting singing
and the balalaka and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken
peasants came out wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over
their shoulders.

Get in get in! shouted one of them a young thick-necked peasant with
a fleshy face red as a carrot. Ill take you all get in!

But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the
crowd.

Take us all with a beast like that!

Why Mikolka are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?

And this mare is twenty if she is a day mates!

Get in Ill take you all Mikolka shouted again leaping first into
the cart seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. The bay
has gone with Matvey he shouted from the cart--and this brute mates
is just breaking my heart I feel as if I could kill her. Shes just
eating her head off. Get in I tell you! Ill make her gallop! Shell
gallop! and he picked up the whip preparing himself with relish to
flog the little mare.

Get in! Come along! The crowd laughed. Dyou hear shell gallop!

Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!

Shell jog along!

Dont you mind her mates bring a whip each of you get ready!

All right! Give it to her!

They all clambered into Mikolkas cart laughing and making jokes. Six
men got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat
rosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton in a pointed beaded
headdress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.
The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed how could they help
laughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a
gallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to
help Mikolka. With the cry of now the mare tugged with all her might
but far from galloping could scarcely move forward; she struggled with
her legs gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which
were showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the
crowd was redoubled but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed
the mare as though he supposed she really could gallop.

Let me get in too mates shouted a young man in the crowd whose
appetite was aroused.

Get in all get in cried Mikolka she will draw you all. Ill beat
her to death! And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare beside himself
with fury.

Father father he cried father what are they doing? Father they
are beating the poor horse!

Come along come along! said his father. They are drunken and
foolish they are in fun; come away dont look! and he tried to draw
him away but he tore himself away from his hand and beside himself
with horror ran to the horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She was
gasping standing still then tugging again and almost falling.

Beat her to death cried Mikolka its come to that. Ill do for
her!

What are you about are you a Christian you devil? shouted an old man
in the crowd.

Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such a
cartload said another.

Youll kill her shouted the third.

Dont meddle! Its my property Ill do what I choose. Get in more of
you! Get in all of you! I will have her go at a gallop!...

All at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare
roused by the shower of blows began feebly kicking. Even the old man
could not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like that
trying to kick!

Two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her
about the ribs. One ran each side.

Hit her in the face in the eyes in the eyes cried Mikolka.

Give us a song mates shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the
cart joined in a riotous song jingling a tambourine and whistling. The
woman went on cracking nuts and laughing.

... He ran beside the mare ran in front of her saw her being whipped
across the eyes right in the eyes! He was crying he felt choking his
tears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across
the face he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming he
rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard who was
shaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and
would have taken him away but he tore himself from her and ran back to
the mare. She was almost at the last gasp but began kicking once more.

Ill teach you to kick Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw down
the whip bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long
thick shaft he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort
brandished it over the mare.

Hell crush her was shouted round him. Hell kill her!

Its my property shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a
swinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.

Thrash her thrash her! Why have you stopped? shouted voices in the
crowd.

And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time
on the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches but
lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force tugged first on
one side and then on the other trying to move the cart. But the six
whips were attacking her in all directions and the shaft was raised
again and fell upon her a third time then a fourth with heavy measured
blows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.

Shes a tough one was shouted in the crowd.

Shell fall in a minute mates there will soon be an end of her said
an admiring spectator in the crowd.

Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off shouted a third.

Ill show you! Stand off Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down
the shaft stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. Look
out he shouted and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the
poor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered sank back tried to pull
but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on
the ground like a log.

Finish her off shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself out of
the cart. Several young men also flushed with drink seized anything
they could come across--whips sticks poles and ran to the dying
mare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the
crowbar. The mare stretched out her head drew a long breath and died.

You butchered her someone shouted in the crowd.

Why wouldnt she gallop then?

My property! shouted Mikolka with bloodshot eyes brandishing the bar
in his hands. He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to
beat.

No mistake about it you are not a Christian many voices were
shouting in the crowd.

But the poor boy beside himself made his way screaming through the
crowd to the sorrel nag put his arms round her bleeding dead head and
kissed it kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up and
flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instant
his father who had been running after him snatched him up and carried
him out of the crowd.

Come along come! Let us go home he said to him.

Father! Why did they... kill... the poor horse! he sobbed but his
voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.

They are drunk.... They are brutal... its not our business! said his
father. He put his arms round his father but he felt choked choked. He
tried to draw a breath to cry out--and woke up.

He waked up gasping for breath his hair soaked with perspiration and
stood up in terror.

Thank God that was only a dream he said sitting down under a tree
and drawing deep breaths. But what is it? Is it some fever coming on?
Such a hideous dream!

He felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul. He
rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.

Good God! he cried can it be can it be that I shall really take an
axe that I shall strike her on the head split her skull open... that I
shall tread in the sticky warm blood break the lock steal and tremble;
hide all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God can it
be?

He was shaking like a leaf as he said this.

But why am I going on like this? he continued sitting up again as it
were in profound amazement. I knew that I could never bring myself
to it so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday
yesterday when I went to make that... _experiment_ yesterday I
realised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I going
over it again then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairs
yesterday I said myself that it was base loathsome vile vile... the
very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.

No I couldnt do it I couldnt do it! Granted granted that there is
no flaw in all that reasoning that all that I have concluded this last
month is clear as day true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldnt
bring myself to it! I couldnt do it I couldnt do it! Why why then am
I still...?

He rose to his feet looked round in wonder as though surprised at
finding himself in this place and went towards the bridge. He was pale
his eyes glowed he was exhausted in every limb but he seemed suddenly
to breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that
had so long been weighing upon him and all at once there was a sense
of relief and peace in his soul. Lord he prayed show me my path--I
renounce that accursed... dream of mine.

Crossing the bridge he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva at the
glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness he
was not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had been
forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom
freedom! He was free from that spell that sorcery that obsession!

Later on when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during
those days minute by minute point by point he was superstitiously
impressed by one circumstance which though in itself not very
exceptional always seemed to him afterwards the predestined
turning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to
himself why when he was tired and worn out when it would have been
more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way
he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was
obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way though not much so. It
is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without
noticing what streets he passed through. But why he was always asking
himself why had such an important such a decisive and at the same time
such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he
had moreover no reason to go) at the very hour the very minute of his
life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances
in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive
influence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait for
him on purpose!

It was about nine oclock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables
and the barrows at the booths and the shops all the market people were
closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their
wares and like their customers were going home. Rag pickers and
costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty
and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly
liked this place and the neighbouring alleys when he wandered aimlessly
in the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention
and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At
the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out
with tapes thread cotton handkerchiefs etc. They too had got up to
go home but were lingering in conversation with a friend who had just
come up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna or as everyone
called her Lizaveta the younger sister of the old pawnbroker Alyona
Ivanovna whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his
watch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta
and she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about
thirty-five tall clumsy timid submissive and almost idiotic. She was
a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister who
made her work day and night and even beat her. She was standing with
a bundle before the huckster and his wife listening earnestly and
doubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The
moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her he was overcome by a strange
sensation as it were of intense astonishment though there was nothing
astonishing about this meeting.

You could make up your mind for yourself Lizaveta Ivanovna the
huckster was saying aloud. Come round to-morrow about seven. They will
be here too.

To-morrow? said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully as though unable to
make up her mind.

Upon my word what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna gabbled
the hucksters wife a lively little woman. I look at you you are like
some little babe. And she is not your own sister either--nothing but a
step-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!

But this time dont say a word to Alyona Ivanovna her husband
interrupted; thats my advice but come round to us without asking.
It will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a
notion.

Am I to come?

About seven oclock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be able
to decide for yourself.

And well have a cup of tea added his wife.

All right Ill come said Lizaveta still pondering and she began
slowly moving away.

Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly
unnoticed trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed
by a thrill of horror like a shiver running down his spine. He had
learnt he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt that the next day at
seven oclock Lizaveta the old womans sister and only companion would
be away from home and that therefore at seven oclock precisely the old
woman _would be left alone_.

He was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man
condemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;
but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom
of thought no will and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably
decided.

Certainly if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity he
could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan
than that which had just presented itself. In any case it would have
been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty with
greater exactness and less risk and without dangerous inquiries and
investigations that next day at a certain time an old woman on whose
life an attempt was contemplated would be at home and entirely alone.



CHAPTER VI

Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his
wife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was
nothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been
reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes all
womens things. As the things would have fetched little in the market
they were looking for a dealer. This was Lizavetas business. She
undertook such jobs and was frequently employed as she was very honest
and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule
little and as we have said already she was very submissive and timid.

But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of
superstition remained in him long after and were almost ineradicable.
And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something
strange and mysterious as it were the presence of some peculiar
influences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew
called Pokorev who had left for Harkov had chanced in conversation to
give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna the old pawnbroker in case he
might want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her for
he had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had
remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his
fathers old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones
a present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When
he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her
at the first glance though he knew nothing special about her. He got
two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way
home. He asked for tea sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange
idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg and very very
much absorbed him.

Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student whom he
did not know and had never seen and with him a young officer. They had
played a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard
the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and
give him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he
had just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course
it was a chance but he could not shake off a very extraordinary
impression and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;
the student began telling his friend various details about Alyona
Ivanovna.

She is first-rate he said. You can always get money from her. She is
as rich as a Jew she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and
she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have
had dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy....

And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was how if you
were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she
gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven
percent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on saying
that she had a sister Lizaveta whom the wretched little creature was
continually beating and kept in complete bondage like a small child
though Lizaveta was at least six feet high.

Theres a phenomenon for you cried the student and he laughed.

They began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a
peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened
with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending
for him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about
her. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister
being the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked
day and night for her sister and besides doing the cooking and the
washing she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister
all she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind
without her sisters permission. The old woman had already made her
will and Lizaveta knew of it and by this will she would not get a
farthing; nothing but the movables chairs and so on; all the money was
left to a monastery in the province of N---- that prayers might be
said for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister
unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance remarkably tall with long
feet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered
goatskin shoes and was clean in her person. What the student expressed
most surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was
continually with child.

But you say she is hideous? observed the officer.

Yes she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up but
you know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured face
and eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are
attracted by her. She is such a soft gentle creature ready to put up
with anything always willing willing to do anything. And her smile is
really very sweet.

You seem to find her attractive yourself laughed the officer.

From her queerness. No Ill tell you what. I could kill that damned
old woman and make off with her money I assure you without the
faintest conscience-prick the student added with warmth. The officer
laughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!

Listen I want to ask you a serious question the student said hotly.
I was joking of course but look here; on one side we have a stupid
senseless worthless spiteful ailing horrid old woman not simply
useless but doing actual mischief who has not an idea what she is
living for herself and who will die in a day or two in any case. You
understand? You understand?

Yes yes I understand answered the officer watching his excited
companion attentively.

Well listen then. On the other side fresh young lives thrown away for
want of help and by thousands on every side! A hundred thousand good
deeds could be done and helped on that old womans money which will be
buried in a monastery! Hundreds thousands perhaps might be set on the
right path; dozens of families saved from destitution from ruin from
vice from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her take
her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of
humanity and the good of all. What do you think would not one tiny
crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands
would be saved from corruption and decay. One death and a hundred lives
in exchange--its simple arithmetic! Besides what value has the life of
that sickly stupid ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!
No more than the life of a louse of a black-beetle less in fact
because the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of
others; the other day she bit Lizavetas finger out of spite; it almost
had to be amputated.

Of course she does not deserve to live remarked the officer but
there it is its nature.

Oh well brother but we have to correct and direct nature and but
for that we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that
there would never have been a single great man. They talk of
duty conscience--I dont want to say anything against duty and
conscience;--but the point is what do we mean by them? Stay I have
another question to ask you. Listen!

No you stay Ill ask you a question. Listen!

Well?

You are talking and speechifying away but tell me would you kill the
old woman _yourself_?

Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it.... Its nothing to
do with me....

But I think if you would not do it yourself theres no justice about
it.... Let us have another game.

Raskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course it was all ordinary
youthful talk and thought such as he had often heard before in
different forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hear
such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain
was just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why just at the
moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old
woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? This
coincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavern
had an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had
really been in it something preordained some guiding hint....

*****

On returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat
for a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had no
candle and indeed it did not occur to him to light up. He could never
recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. At
last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering and he realised
with relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy leaden sleep
came over him as it were crushing him.

He slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya
coming into his room at ten oclock the next morning had difficulty
in rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again the
second brew and again in her own tea-pot.

My goodness how he sleeps! she cried indignantly. And he is always
asleep.

He got up with an effort. His head ached he stood up took a turn in
his garret and sank back on the sofa again.

Going to sleep again cried Nastasya. Are you ill eh?

He made no reply.

Do you want some tea?

Afterwards he said with an effort closing his eyes again and turning
to the wall.

Nastasya stood over him.

Perhaps he really is ill she said turned and went out. She came in
again at two oclock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stood
untouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully
rousing him.

Why are you lying like a log? she shouted looking at him with
repulsion.

He got up and sat down again but said nothing and stared at the floor.

Are you ill or not? asked Nastasya and again received no answer.
Youd better go out and get a breath of air she said after a pause.
Will you eat it or not?

Afterwards he said weakly. You can go.

And he motioned her out.

She remained a little longer looked at him with compassion and went
out.

A few minutes afterwards he raised his eyes and looked for a long while
at the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread took up a spoon and
began to eat.

He ate a little three or four spoonfuls without appetite as it were
mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself
on the sofa again but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring
with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such
strange day-dreams; in one that kept recurring he fancied that he was
in Africa in Egypt in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting
the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a
complete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water
from a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool it was
wonderful wonderful blue cold water running among the parti-coloured
stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like
gold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started roused himself
raised his head looked out of the window and seeing how late it was
suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the
sofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door stealthily opened it and began
listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet
on the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and
monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the
previous day and had done nothing had prepared nothing yet.... And
meanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction
were followed by an extraordinary feverish as it were distracted
haste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his
energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart
kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had
to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He
rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away
under it a worn out old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long
strip a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded
this strip in two took off his wide strong summer overcoat of some
stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two
ends of the rag on the inside under the left armhole. His hands shook
as he sewed but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside
when he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready
long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the
noose it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended
for the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the
street in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have
had to support it with his hand which would have been noticeable. Now
he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose and it would hang
quietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat
pocket he could hold the end of the handle all the way so that it did
not swing; and as the coat was very full a regular sack in fact it
could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the
hand that was in the pocket. This noose too he had designed a
fortnight before.

When he had finished with this he thrust his hand into a little opening
between his sofa and the floor fumbled in the left corner and drew out
the _pledge_ which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This
pledge was however only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and
thickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood
in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of
a workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece
of iron which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.
Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood
he fastened them very firmly crossing and re-crossing the thread round
them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and
tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This
was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time while
she was trying to undo the knot and so to gain a moment. The iron strip
was added to give weight so that the woman might not guess the first
minute that the thing was made of wood. All this had been stored by
him beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when
he heard someone suddenly about in the yard.

It struck six long ago.

Long ago! My God!

He rushed to the door listened caught up his hat and began to descend
his thirteen steps cautiously noiselessly like a cat. He had still the
most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the
deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a
pocket pruning-knife but he could not rely on the knife and still less
on his own strength and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in
passing one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by
him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final
they were the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in
his eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle he never for
a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his
plans.

And indeed if it had ever happened that everything to the least point
could have been considered and finally settled and no uncertainty of
any kind had remained he would it seems have renounced it all
as something absurd monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of
unsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe
that trifling business cost him no anxiety for nothing could be easier.
Nastasya was continually out of the house especially in the evenings;
she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop and always left the
door ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her
about. And so when the time came he would only have to go quietly into
the kitchen and to take the axe and an hour later (when everything
was over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.
Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back and Nastasya had
come back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait
till she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss
the axe look for it make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at
least grounds for suspicion.

But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider and
indeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point and put off
trifling details until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed
utterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not
imagine for instance that he would sometime leave off thinking get
up and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with
the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at
an experiment far from being the real thing as though one should say
come let us go and try it--why dream about it!--and at once he
had broken down and had run away cursing in a frenzy with himself.
Meanwhile it would seem as regards the moral question that his
analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor and he
could not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort
he simply ceased to believe in himself and doggedly slavishly sought
arguments in all directions fumbling for them as though someone were
forcing and drawing him to it.

At first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one
question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily
detected and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He
had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions and in his
opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility
of concealing the crime as in the criminal himself. Almost every
criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a
childish and phenomenal heedlessness at the very instant when prudence
and caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse
of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease
developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the
perpetration of the crime continued with equal violence at the moment
of the crime and for longer or shorter time after according to the
individual case and then passed off like any other disease. The
question whether the disease gives rise to the crime or whether the
crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of
the nature of disease he did not yet feel able to decide.

When he reached these conclusions he decided that in his own case there
could not be such a morbid reaction that his reason and will would
remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design for the
simple reason that his design was not a crime.... We will omit all the
process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have
run too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical purely
material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his
mind. One has but to keep all ones will-power and reason to deal
with them and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has
familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business.... But
this preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he
came to trust least and when the hour struck it all came to pass quite
differently as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.

One trifling circumstance upset his calculations before he had even
left the staircase. When he reached the landladys kitchen the door
of which was open as usual he glanced cautiously in to see whether in
Nastasyas absence the landlady herself was there or if not whether
the door to her own room was closed so that she might not peep out when
he went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly
saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen but was occupied
there taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing
him she left off hanging the clothes turned to him and stared at him
all the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes and walked past as
though he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not
the axe! He was overwhelmed.

What made me think he reflected as he went under the gateway what
made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!
Why why why did I assume this so certainly?

He was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in
his anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.

He stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street to go a walk
for appearance sake was revolting; to go back to his room even more
revolting. And what a chance I have lost for ever! he muttered
standing aimlessly in the gateway just opposite the porters little
dark room which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porters
room two paces away from him something shining under the bench to the
right caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the
room on tiptoe went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called
the porter. Yes not at home! Somewhere near though in the yard for
the door is wide open. He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled
it out from under the bench where it lay between two chunks of wood;
at once before going out he made it fast in the noose he thrust both
hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!
When reason fails the devil helps! he thought with a strange grin.
This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.

He walked along quietly and sedately without hurry to avoid awakening
suspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by tried to escape looking
at their faces at all and to be as little noticeable as possible.
Suddenly he thought of his hat. Good heavens! I had the money the day
before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead! A curse rose
from the bottom of his soul.

Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop he saw by a clock on
the wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at
the same time to go someway round so as to approach the house from the
other side....

When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand he had sometimes
thought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much
afraid now was not afraid at all indeed. His mind was even occupied
by irrelevant matters but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov
garden he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great
fountains and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all
the squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer
garden were extended to the field of Mars and perhaps joined to the
garden of the Mihailovsky Palace it would be a splendid thing and a
great benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why
in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity but in some
peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there
are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all
sorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back
to his mind and for a moment he waked up to reality. What nonsense!
 he thought better think of nothing at all!

So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that
meets them on the way flashed through his mind but simply flashed
like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now
he was near; here was the house here was the gate. Suddenly a clock
somewhere struck once. What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible it
must be fast!

Luckily for him everything went well again at the gates. At that very
moment as though expressly for his benefit a huge waggon of hay had
just driven in at the gate completely screening him as he passed under
the gateway and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into
the yard before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other
side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one
noticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge
quadrangular yard were open at that moment but he did not raise his
head--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old
womans room was close by just on the right of the gateway. He was
already on the stairs....

Drawing a breath pressing his hand against his throbbing heart and
once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight he began softly
and cautiously ascending the stairs listening every minute. But the
stairs too were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no
one. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were
at work in it but they did not glance at him. He stood still thought
a minute and went on. Of course it would be better if they had not been
here but... its two storeys above them.

And there was the fourth storey here was the door here was the
flat opposite the empty one. The flat underneath the old womans was
apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been
torn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant
the thought floated through his mind Shall I go back? But he made no
answer and began listening at the old womans door a dead silence. Then
he listened again on the staircase listened long and intently...
then looked about him for the last time pulled himself together drew
himself up and once more tried the axe in the noose. Am I very pale?
 he wondered. Am I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I
better wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?

But his heart did not leave off. On the contrary as though to spite
him it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer
he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he
rang again more loudly.

No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman
was of course at home but she was suspicious and alone. He had some
knowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.
Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to
suppose) or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway he suddenly
heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the
rustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily
close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly
listening within and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved
a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have
the appearance of hiding then rang a third time but quietly soberly
and without impatience Recalling it afterwards that moment stood out
in his mind vividly distinctly for ever; he could not make out how he
had had such cunning for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and
he was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the
latch unfastened.



CHAPTER VII

The door was as before opened a tiny crack and again two sharp and
suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost
his head and nearly made a great mistake.

Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone and not
hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions he took
hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from
attempting to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back
but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with
it on to the stairs. Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not
allowing him to pass he advanced straight upon her. She stepped back
in alarm tried to say something but seemed unable to speak and stared
with open eyes at him.

Good evening Alyona Ivanovna he began trying to speak easily but
his voice would not obey him it broke and shook. I have come... I have
brought something... but wed better come in... to the light....

And leaving her he passed straight into the room uninvited. The old
woman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.

Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?

Why Alyona Ivanovna you know me... Raskolnikov... here I brought you
the pledge I promised the other day... And he held out the pledge.

The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge but at once stared in
the eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently maliciously and
mistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer
in her eyes as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that
he was losing his head that he was almost frightened so frightened
that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half
minute he thought he would have run away from her.

Why do you look at me as though you did not know me? he said suddenly
also with malice. Take it if you like if not Ill go elsewhere I am
in a hurry.

He had not even thought of saying this but it was suddenly said of
itself. The old woman recovered herself and her visitors resolute tone
evidently restored her confidence.

But why my good sir all of a minute.... What is it? she asked
looking at the pledge.

The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time you know.

She held out her hand.

But how pale you are to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?
Have you been bathing or what?

Fever he answered abruptly. You cant help getting pale... if youve
nothing to eat he added with difficulty articulating the words.

His strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the
truth; the old woman took the pledge.

What is it? she asked once more scanning Raskolnikov intently and
weighing the pledge in her hand.

A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it.

It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!

Trying to untie the string and turning to the window to the light (all
her windows were shut in spite of the stifling heat) she left
him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He
unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose but did not yet
take it out altogether simply holding it in his right hand under the
coat. His hands were fearfully weak he felt them every moment growing
more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and
fall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.

But what has he tied it up like this for? the old woman cried with
vexation and moved towards him.

He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out swung
it with both arms scarcely conscious of himself and almost without
effort almost mechanically brought the blunt side down on her head. He
seemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once
brought the axe down his strength returned to him.

The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin light hair streaked
with grey thickly smeared with grease was plaited in a rats tail and
fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.
As she was so short the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She
cried out but very faintly and suddenly sank all of a heap on the
floor raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held the
pledge. Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side
and on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass the
body fell back. He stepped back let it fall and at once bent over her
face; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets
the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.

He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her
pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket
from which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full
possession of his faculties free from confusion or giddiness but his
hands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been
particularly collected and careful trying all the time not to get
smeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once they were all
as before in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom
with them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.
Against the other wall stood a big bed very clean and covered with
a silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of
drawers. Strange to say so soon as he began to fit the keys into the
chest so soon as he heard their jingling a convulsive shudder passed
over him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go
away. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.
He positively smiled at himself when suddenly another terrifying idea
occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be
still alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest
he ran back to the body snatched up the axe and lifted it once more
over the old woman but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that
she was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely he saw
clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He
was about to feel it with his finger but drew back his hand and indeed
it was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of
blood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it but
the string was strong and did not snap and besides it was soaked
with blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress but
something held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised
the axe again to cut the string from above on the body but did not
dare and with difficulty smearing his hand and the axe in the blood
after two minutes hurried effort he cut the string and took it off
without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a
purse. On the string were two crosses one of Cyprus wood and one of
copper and an image in silver filigree and with them a small greasy
chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed
very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it
flung the crosses on the old womans body and rushed back into the
bedroom this time taking the axe with him.

He was in terrible haste he snatched the keys and began trying them
again. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It
was not so much that his hands were shaking but that he kept making
mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one
and would not fit still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered
and realised that the big key with the deep notches which was hanging
there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of
drawers (on his last visit this had struck him) but to some strong box
and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest
of drawers and at once felt under the bedstead knowing that old
women usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a
good-sized box under the bed at least a yard in length with an arched
lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched
key fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top under a white sheet was
a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress
then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but
clothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on
the red brocade. Its red and on red blood will be less noticeable
 the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.
Good God am I going out of my senses? he thought with terror.

But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from
under the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned
out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably
all pledges unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets chains
ear-rings pins and such things. Some were in cases others simply
wrapped in newspaper carefully and exactly folded and tied round with
tape. Without any delay he began filling up the pockets of his trousers
and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he
had not time to take many....

He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped
short and was still as death. But all was quiet so it must have been
his fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry as though
someone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for
a minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited
holding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up seized the axe and ran out of
the bedroom.

In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.
She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister white as a sheet
and seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out
of the bedroom she began faintly quivering all over like a leaf a
shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand opened her mouth but
still did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the
corner staring intently persistently at him but still uttered no
sound as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her
with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously as one sees babies mouths
when they begin to be frightened stare intently at what frightens them
and are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so
simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not
even raise a hand to guard her face though that was the most necessary
and natural action at the moment for the axe was raised over her face.
She only put up her empty left hand but not to her face slowly holding
it out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the
sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the
head. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head
snatching up her bundle dropped it again and ran into the entry.

Fear gained more and more mastery over him especially after this
second quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place
as fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing
and reasoning more correctly if he had been able to realise all the
difficulties of his position the hopelessness the hideousness and the
absurdity of it if he could have understood how many obstacles and
perhaps crimes he had still to overcome or to commit to get out of
that place and to make his way home it is very possible that he would
have flung up everything and would have gone to give himself up and
not from fear but from simple horror and loathing of what he had
done. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew
stronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even
into the room for anything in the world.

But a sort of blankness even dreaminess had begun by degrees to take
possession of him; at moments he forgot himself or rather forgot what
was of importance and caught at trifles. Glancing however into the
kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench he bethought
him of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.
He dropped the axe with the blade in the water snatched a piece of soap
that lay in a broken saucer on the window and began washing his hands
in the bucket. When they were clean he took out the axe washed the
blade and spent a long time about three minutes washing the wood where
there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all
with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and
then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.
There was no trace left on it only the wood was still damp. He
carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was
possible in the dim light in the kitchen he looked over his overcoat
his trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be
nothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.
But he knew he was not looking thoroughly that there might be something
quite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the
room lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea
that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning
of protecting himself that he ought perhaps to be doing something
utterly different from what he was now doing. Good God! he muttered I
must fly fly and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror
awaited him such as he had never known before.

He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door the outer
door from the stairs at which he had not long before waited and rung
was standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock no bolt
all the time all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him
perhaps as a precaution. But good God! Why he had seen Lizaveta
afterwards! And how could he how could he have failed to reflect that
she must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!

He dashed to the door and fastened the latch.

But no the wrong thing again! I must get away get away....

He unfastened the latch opened the door and began listening on the
staircase.

He listened a long time. Somewhere far away it might be in the gateway
two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting quarrelling and scolding.
What are they about? He waited patiently. At last all was still as
though suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out
but suddenly on the floor below a door was noisily opened and someone
began going downstairs humming a tune. How is it they all make such
a noise? flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and
waited. At last all was still not a soul stirring. He was just taking a
step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.

The steps sounded very far off at the very bottom of the stairs but
he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he
began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_
to the fourth floor to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow
peculiar significant? The steps were heavy even and unhurried. Now
_he_ had passed the first floor now he was mounting higher it was
growing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And
now the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to
him all at once that he was turned to stone that it was like a dream
in which one is being pursued nearly caught and will be killed and is
rooted to the spot and cannot even move ones arms.

At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor he suddenly
started and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the
flat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly
noiselessly fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had
done this he crouched holding his breath by the door. The unknown
visitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one
another as he had just before been standing with the old woman when
the door divided them and he was listening.

The visitor panted several times. He must be a big fat man thought
Raskolnikov squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream
indeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.

As soon as the tin bell tinkled Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of
something moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite
seriously. The unknown rang again waited and suddenly tugged violently
and impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror
at the hook shaking in its fastening and in blank terror expected every
minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem
possible so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the
fastening but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him
again. I shall fall down! flashed through his mind but the unknown
began to speak and he recovered himself at once.

Whats up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them! he bawled in a
thick voice Hey Alyona Ivanovna old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna hey
my beauty! open the door! Oh damn them! Are they asleep or what?

And again enraged he tugged with all his might a dozen times at
the bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate
acquaintance.

At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off on the
stairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at
first.

You dont say theres no one at home the new-comer cried in a
cheerful ringing voice addressing the first visitor who still went on
pulling the bell. Good evening Koch.

From his voice he must be quite young thought Raskolnikov.

Who the devil can tell? Ive almost broken the lock answered Koch.
But how do you come to know me?

Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at
billiards at Gambrinus.

Oh!

So they are not at home? Thats queer. Its awfully stupid though.
Where could the old woman have gone? Ive come on business.

Yes; and I have business with her too.

Well what can we do? Go back I suppose Aie--aie! And I was hoping to
get some money! cried the young man.

We must give it up of course but what did she fix this time for? The
old witch fixed the time for me to come herself. Its out of my way.
And where the devil she can have got to I cant make out. She sits here
from years end to years end the old hag; her legs are bad and yet
here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!

Hadnt we better ask the porter?

What?

Where shes gone and when shell be back.

Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go
anywhere.

And he once more tugged at the door-handle.

Damn it all. Theres nothing to be done we must go!

Stay! cried the young man suddenly. Do you see how the door shakes if
you pull it?

Well?

That shows its not locked but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how
the hook clanks?

Well?

Why dont you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they
were all out they would have locked the door from the outside with the
key and not with the hook from inside. There do you hear how the hook
is clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home
dont you see. So there they are sitting inside and dont open the
door!

Well! And so they must be! cried Koch astonished. What are they
about in there? And he began furiously shaking the door.

Stay! cried the young man again. Dont pull at it! There must be
something wrong.... Here youve been ringing and pulling at the door
and still they dont open! So either theyve both fainted or...

What?

I tell you what. Lets go fetch the porter let him wake them up.

All right.

Both were going down.

Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter.

What for?

Well youd better.

All right.

Im studying the law you see! Its evident e-vi-dent theres something
wrong here! the young man cried hotly and he ran downstairs.

Koch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one
tinkle then gently as though reflecting and looking about him began
touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once
more that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he
bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock
on the inside and so nothing could be seen.

Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of
delirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.
While they were knocking and talking together the idea several times
occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the
door. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them to jeer at them
while they could not open the door! Only make haste! was the thought
that flashed through his mind.

But what the devil is he about?... Time was passing one minute and
another--no one came. Koch began to be restless.

What the devil? he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his
sentry duty he too went down hurrying and thumping with his heavy
boots on the stairs. The steps died away.

Good heavens! What am I to do?

Raskolnikov unfastened the hook opened the door--there was no sound.
Abruptly without any thought at all he went out closing the door as
thoroughly as he could and went downstairs.

He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice
below--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going
back to the flat.

Hey there! Catch the brute!

Somebody dashed out of a flat below shouting and rather fell than ran
down the stairs bawling at the top of his voice.

Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!

The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was
still. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began
noisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He
distinguished the ringing voice of the young man. Hey!

Filled with despair he went straight to meet them feeling come what
must! If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was
lost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only
a flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the
right there was an empty flat with the door wide open the flat on the
second floor where the painters had been at work and which as though
for his benefit they had just left. It was they no doubt who had just
run down shouting. The floor had only just been painted in the middle
of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one
instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall
and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.
Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor talking loudly. He
waited went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.

No one was on the stairs nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through
the gateway and turned to the left in the street.

He knew he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the
flat that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked as
the door had just been fastened that by now they were looking at the
bodies that before another minute had passed they would guess and
completely realise that the murderer had just been there and had
succeeded in hiding somewhere slipping by them and escaping. They would
guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat while they were
going upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much though
the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. Should he
slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No
hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless
hopeless!

At last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.
Here he was half way to safety and he understood it; it was less risky
because there was a great crowd of people and he was lost in it like a
grain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could
scarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops his neck was all wet.
My word he has been going it! someone shouted at him when he came out
on the canal bank.

He was only dimly conscious of himself now and the farther he went the
worse it was. He remembered however that on coming out on to the canal
bank he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more
conspicuous and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost
falling from fatigue he went a long way round so as to get home from
quite a different direction.

He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his
house! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.
And yet he had a very grave problem before him to put it back and to
escape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course
incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to
restore the axe at all but to drop it later on in somebodys yard. But
it all happened fortunately the door of the porters room was closed
but not locked so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at
home. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he
walked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him
What do you want? he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But
again the porter was not at home and he succeeded in putting the axe
back under the bench and even covering it with the chunk of wood as
before. He met no one not a soul afterwards on the way to his room;
the landladys door was shut. When he was in his room he flung himself
on the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep but sank into blank
forgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then he would have
jumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were
simply swarming in his brain but he could not catch at one he could
not rest on one in spite of all his efforts....




PART II



CHAPTER I

So he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to wake up and at
such moments he noticed that it was far into the night but it did not
occur to him to get up. At last he noticed that it was beginning to get
light. He was lying on his back still dazed from his recent oblivion.
Fearful despairing cries rose shrilly from the street sounds which he
heard every night indeed under his window after two oclock. They woke
him up now.

Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns he thought its
past two oclock and at once he leaped up as though someone had
pulled him from the sofa.

What! Past two oclock!

He sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything! All at
once in one flash he recollected everything.

For the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came
over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in
his sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering so that his
teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and
began listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he
gazed at himself and everything in the room around him wondering how he
could have come in the night before without fastening the door and have
flung himself on the sofa without undressing without even taking his
hat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.

If anyone had come in what would he have thought? That Im drunk
but...

He rushed to the window. There was light enough and he began hurriedly
looking himself all over from head to foot all his clothes; were there
no traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold he
began taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything
over to the last threads and rags and mistrusting himself went through
his search three times.

But there seemed to be nothing no trace except in one place where
some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge
of his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed
threads. There seemed to be nothing more.

Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of
the old womans box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till
then of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them
while he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed
to take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out
everything and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was
nothing left he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had
come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began
stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: Theyre in! All
out of sight and the purse too! he thought gleefully getting up and
gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly
he shuddered all over with horror; My God! he whispered in despair:
whats the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide
things?

He had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of
money and so had not prepared a hiding-place.

But now now what am I glad of? he thought Is that hiding things?
My reasons deserting me--simply!

He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another
unbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside
him his old students winter coat which was still warm though almost in
rags covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and
delirium. He lost consciousness.

Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time
and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.

How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes yes; I have not
taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it forgot a thing like that!
Such a piece of evidence!

He pulled off the noose hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits
among his linen under the pillow.

Pieces of torn linen couldnt rouse suspicion whatever happened; I
think not I think not any way! he repeated standing in the middle
of the room and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about
him again at the floor and everywhere trying to make sure he had not
forgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties even memory
and the simplest power of reflection were failing him began to be an
insufferable torture.

Surely it isnt beginning already! Surely it isnt my punishment coming
upon me? It is!

The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the
floor in the middle of the room where anyone coming in would see them!

What is the matter with me! he cried again like one distraught.

Then a strange idea entered his head; that perhaps all his clothes
were covered with blood that perhaps there were a great many
stains but that he did not see them did not notice them because
his perceptions were failing were going to pieces... his reason was
clouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the
purse too. Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too for I put
the wet purse in my pocket!

In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and yes!--there were
traces stains on the lining of the pocket!

So my reason has not quite deserted me so I still have some sense and
memory since I guessed it of myself he thought triumphantly with
a deep sigh of relief; its simply the weakness of fever a moments
delirium and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his
trousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the
sock which poked out from the boot he fancied there were traces! He
flung off his boots; traces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with
blood; he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... But what am I
to do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?

He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the
room.

In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?
But what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No better
go out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes better throw it away he
repeated sitting down on the sofa again and at once this minute
without lingering...

But his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy
shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.

And for a long while for some hours he was haunted by the impulse to
go off somewhere at once this moment and fling it all away so that
it may be out of sight and done with at once at once! Several times
he tried to rise from the sofa but could not.

He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.

Open do are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here! shouted
Nastasya banging with her fist on the door. For whole days together
hes snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. Its
past ten.

Maybe hes not at home said a mans voice.

Ha! thats the porters voice.... What does he want?

He jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a
positive pain.

Then who can have latched the door? retorted Nastasya. Hes taken to
bolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open you stupid wake
up!

What do they want? Why the porter? Alls discovered. Resist or open?
Come what may!...

He half rose stooped forward and unlatched the door.

His room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the
bed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.

Nastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and
desperate air at the porter who without a word held out a grey folded
paper sealed with bottle-wax.

A notice from the office he announced as he gave him the paper.

From what office?

A summons to the police office of course. You know which office.

To the police?... What for?...

How can I tell? Youre sent for so you go.

The man looked at him attentively looked round the room and turned to
go away.

Hes downright ill! observed Nastasya not taking her eyes off him.
The porter turned his head for a moment. Hes been in a fever since
yesterday she added.

Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands without
opening it. Dont you get up then Nastasya went on compassionately
seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. Youre ill and
so dont go; theres no such hurry. What have you got there?

He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his
trousers the sock and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep
with them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it he remembered that
half waking up in his fever he had grasped all this tightly in his hand
and so fallen asleep again.

Look at the rags hes collected and sleeps with them as though he has
got hold of a treasure...

And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.

Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his
eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational
reflection at that moment he felt that no one would behave like that
with a person who was going to be arrested. But... the police?

Youd better have some tea! Yes? Ill bring it theres some left.

No... Im going; Ill go at once he muttered getting on to his feet.

Why youll never get downstairs!

Yes Ill go.

As you please.

She followed the porter out.

At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.

There are stains but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt
and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could
distinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed
thank God! Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began
reading; he was a long while reading before he understood. It was an
ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at
half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.

But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with
the police! And why just to-day? he thought in agonising bewilderment.
Good God only get it over soon!

He was flinging himself on his knees to pray but broke into
laughter--not at the idea of prayer but at himself.

He began hurriedly dressing. If Im lost I am lost I dont care!
Shall I put the sock on? he suddenly wondered it will get dustier
still and the traces will be gone.

But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing
and horror. He pulled it off but reflecting that he had no other socks
he picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.

Thats all conventional thats all relative merely a way of looking
at it he thought in a flash but only on the top surface of his
mind while he was shuddering all over there Ive got it on! I have
finished by getting it on!

But his laughter was quickly followed by despair.

No its too much for me... he thought. His legs shook. From fear
 he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. Its a trick! They
want to decoy me there and confound me over everything he mused as
he went out on to the stairs--the worst of it is Im almost
light-headed... I may blurt out something stupid...

On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as
they were in the hole in the wall and very likely its on purpose
to search when Im out he thought and stopped short. But he was
possessed by such despair such cynicism of misery if one may so call
it that with a wave of his hand he went on. Only to get it over!

In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had
fallen all those days. Again dust bricks and mortar again the stench
from the shops and pot-houses again the drunken men the Finnish
pedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes
so that it hurt him to look out of them and he felt his head going
round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the
street on a bright sunny day.

When he reached the turning into _the_ street in an agony of
trepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted
his eyes.

If they question me perhaps Ill simply tell he thought as he drew
near the police-station.

The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been
moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once
for a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway
he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with
a book in his hand. A house-porter no doubt; so then the office is
here and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want
to ask questions of anyone.

Ill go in fall on my knees and confess everything... he thought as
he reached the fourth floor.

The staircase was steep narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The
kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost
the whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase
was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their
arms policemen and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of
the office too stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There
too the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh
paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.

After waiting a little he decided to move forward into the next room.
All the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him
on and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some
clerks sat writing dressed hardly better than he was and rather a
queer-looking set. He went up to one of them.

What is it?

He showed the notice he had received.

You are a student? the man asked glancing at the notice.

Yes formerly a student.

The clerk looked at him but without the slightest interest. He was a
particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.

There would be no getting anything out of him because he has no
interest in anything thought Raskolnikov.

Go in there to the head clerk said the clerk pointing towards the
furthest room.

He went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and
packed full of people rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.
Among them were two ladies. One poorly dressed in mourning sat at the
table opposite the chief clerk writing something at his dictation.
The other a very stout buxom woman with a purplish-red blotchy face
excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a
saucer was standing on one side apparently waiting for something.
Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced
at it said: Wait a minute and went on attending to the lady in
mourning.

He breathed more freely. It cant be that!

By degrees he began to regain confidence he kept urging himself to have
courage and be calm.

Some foolishness some trifling carelessness and I may betray myself!
Hm... its a pity theres no air here he added its stifling.... It
makes ones head dizzier than ever... and ones mind too...

He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing
his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it
something quite irrelevant but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet
the head clerk greatly interested him he kept hoping to see through him
and guess something from his face.

He was a very young man about two and twenty with a dark mobile
face that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and
foppish with his hair parted in the middle well combed and pomaded
and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain
on his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who
was in the room and said them fairly correctly.

Luise Ivanovna you can sit down he said casually to the
gaily-dressed purple-faced lady who was still standing as though not
venturing to sit down though there was a chair beside her.

Ich danke said the latter and softly with a rustle of silk she sank
into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated
about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She
smelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half
the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was
impudent as well as cringing it betrayed evident uneasiness.

The lady in mourning had done at last and got up. All at once with
some noise an officer walked in very jauntily with a peculiar swing of
his shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and
sat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her
seat on seeing him and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the
officer took not the smallest notice of her and she did not venture to
sit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He
had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his
face and extremely small features expressive of nothing much except
a certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at
Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed and in spite of his
humiliating position his bearing was by no means in keeping with his
clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on
him so that he felt positively affronted.

What do you want? he shouted apparently astonished that such a ragged
fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.

I was summoned... by a notice... Raskolnikov faltered.

For the recovery of money due from _the student_ the head clerk
interfered hurriedly tearing himself from his papers. Here! and he
flung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. Read that!

Money? What money? thought Raskolnikov but... then... its certainly
not _that_.

And he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A
load was lifted from his back.

And pray what time were you directed to appear sir? shouted the
assistant superintendent seeming for some unknown reason more and more
aggrieved. You are told to come at nine and now its twelve!

The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago Raskolnikov
answered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he too grew
suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. And its enough that
I have come here ill with fever.

Kindly refrain from shouting!

Im not shouting Im speaking very quietly its you who are shouting
at me. Im a student and allow no one to shout at me.

The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he
could only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.

Be silent! You are in a government office. Dont be impudent sir!

Youre in a government office too cried Raskolnikov and youre
smoking a cigarette as well as shouting so you are showing disrespect
to all of us.

He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.

The head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant
superintendent was obviously disconcerted.

Thats not your business! he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.
Kindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr
Grigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You dont pay your
debts! Youre a fine bird!

But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the
paper in haste to find an explanation. He read it once and a second
time and still did not understand.

What is this? he asked the head clerk.

It is for the recovery of money on an I O U a writ. You must
either pay it with all expenses costs and so on or give a written
declaration when you can pay it and at the same time an undertaking not
to leave the capital without payment and nor to sell or conceal your
property. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property and proceed
against you according to the law.

But I... am not in debt to anyone!

Thats not our business. Here an I O U for a hundred and fifteen
roubles legally attested and due for payment has been brought us
for recovery given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn nine
months ago and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.
We therefore summon you hereupon.

But she is my landlady!

And what if she is your landlady?

The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion
and at the same time with a certain triumph as at a novice under fire
for the first time--as though he would say: Well how do you feel now?
 But what did he care now for an I O U for a writ of recovery! Was that
worth worrying about now was it worth attention even! He stood he
read he listened he answered he even asked questions himself but
all mechanically. The triumphant sense of security of deliverance from
overwhelming danger that was what filled his whole soul that moment
without thought for the future without analysis without suppositions
or surmises without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant
of full direct purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment
something like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant
superintendent still shaken by Raskolnikovs disrespect still fuming
and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity pounced on the
unfortunate smart lady who had been gazing at him ever since he came in
with an exceedingly silly smile.

You shameful hussy! he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The
lady in mourning had left the office.) What was going on at your house
last night? Eh! A disgrace again youre a scandal to the whole street.
Fighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why
I have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the
eleventh! And here you are again again you... you...!

The paper fell out of Raskolnikovs hands and he looked wildly at the
smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it
meant and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He
listened with pleasure so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his
nerves were on edge.

Ilya Petrovitch! the head clerk was beginning anxiously but stopped
short for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not
be stopped except by force.

As for the smart lady at first she positively trembled before the
storm. But strange to say the more numerous and violent the terms of
abuse became the more amiable she looked and the more seductive the
smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily and
curtsied incessantly waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her
word: and at last she found it.

There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house Mr. Captain she
pattered all at once like peas dropping speaking Russian confidently
though with a strong German accent and no sort of scandal and his
honour came drunk and its the whole truth I am telling Mr. Captain
and I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house Mr. Captain
and honourable behaviour Mr. Captain and I always always dislike any
scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy and asked for three bottles
again and then he lifted up one leg and began playing the pianoforte
with one foot and that is not at all right in an honourable house and
he _ganz_ broke the piano and it was very bad manners indeed and I said
so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then
I called the porter and Karl came and he took Karl and hit him in the
eye; and he hit Henriette in the eye too and gave me five slaps on the
cheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house Mr. Captain
and I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal and stood in
the window squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of
squealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!
And Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat and it is true
Mr. Captain he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_
pay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him Mr. Captain five
roubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused
all the scandal. I will show you up he said for I can write to all
the papers about you.

Then he was an author?

Yes Mr. Captain and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable
house....

Now then! Enough! I have told you already...

Ilya Petrovitch! the head clerk repeated significantly.

The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his
head.

... So I tell you this most respectable Luise Ivanovna and I tell it
you for the last time the assistant went on. If there is a scandal
in your honourable house once again I will put you yourself in the
lock-up as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary
man an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an honourable
house? A nice set these authors!

And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. There was a scandal
the other day in a restaurant too. An author had eaten his dinner and
would not pay; Ill write a satire on you says he. And there was
another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful
language to the respectable family of a civil councillor his wife and
daughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioners shop
the other day. They are like that authors literary men students
town-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one
day. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?

With hurried deference Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all
directions and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door she
stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh open
face and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of
the district himself Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste
to curtsy almost to the ground and with mincing little steps she
fluttered out of the office.

Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane! said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya
Petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. You are aroused again you are
fuming again! I heard it on the stairs!

Well what then! Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;
and he walked with some papers to another table with a jaunty swing of
his shoulders at each step. Here if you will kindly look: an author
or a student has been one at least does not pay his debts has given
an I O U wont clear out of his room and complaints are constantly
being lodged against him and here he has been pleased to make a protest
against my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself and
just look at him please. Heres the gentleman and very attractive he
is!

Poverty is not a vice my friend but we know you go off like powder
you cant bear a slight I daresay you took offence at something and
went too far yourself continued Nikodim Fomitch turning affably to
Raskolnikov. But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow I assure
you but explosive explosive! He gets hot fires up boils over and no
stopping him! And then its all over! And at the bottom hes a heart of
gold! His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant....

And what a regiment it was too cried Ilya Petrovitch much gratified
at this agreeable banter though still sulky.

Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant
to them all. Excuse me Captain he began easily suddenly addressing
Nikodim Fomitch will you enter into my position?... I am ready to
ask pardon if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student sick
and shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not
studying because I cannot keep myself now but I shall get money.... I
have a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to
me and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman but she is so
exasperated at my having lost my lessons and not paying her for the
last four months that she does not even send up my dinner... and I
dont understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this
I O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves!...

But that is not our business you know the head clerk was observing.

Yes yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain...
 Raskolnikov put in again still addressing Nikodim Fomitch but trying
his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also though the latter persistently
appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously
oblivious of him. Allow me to explain that I have been living with her
for nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not
confess it at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter it
was a verbal promise freely given... she was a girl... indeed I liked
her though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...
that is I mean to say that my landlady gave me credit freely in those
days and I led a life of... I was very heedless...

Nobody asks you for these personal details sir weve no time to
waste Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;
but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly though he suddenly found it
exceedingly difficult to speak.

But excuse me excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all
happened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.
But a year ago the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there as
before and when my landlady moved into her present quarters she said
to me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me
but still would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen
roubles all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that
she would trust me again as much as I liked and that she would never
never--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay
of myself... and now when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to
eat she takes action against me. What am I to say to that?

All these affecting details are no business of ours. Ilya Petrovitch
interrupted rudely. You must give a written undertaking but as for your
love affairs and all these tragic events we have nothing to do with
that.

Come now... you are harsh muttered Nikodim Fomitch sitting down at
the table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.

Write! said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.

Write what? the latter asked gruffly.

I will dictate to you.

Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and
contemptuously after his speech but strange to say he suddenly felt
completely indifferent to anyones opinion and this revulsion took
place in a flash in one instant. If he had cared to think a little
he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like
that a minute before forcing his feelings upon them. And where had
those feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled not
with police officers but with those nearest and dearest to him he
would not have found one human word for them so empty was his heart. A
gloomy sensation of agonising everlasting solitude and remoteness took
conscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental
effusions before Ilya Petrovitch nor the meanness of the latters
triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.
Oh what had he to do now with his own baseness with all these petty
vanities officers German women debts police-offices? If he had been
sentenced to be burnt at that moment he would not have stirred would
hardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to
him entirely new sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood but
he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could
never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental
effusions like his recent outburst or with anything whatever; and that
if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers
it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any
circumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful
sensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a
conception or idea a direct sensation the most agonising of all the
sensations he had known in his life.

The head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration
that he could not pay that he undertook to do so at a future date that
he would not leave the town nor sell his property and so on.

But you cant write you can hardly hold the pen observed the head
clerk looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. Are you ill?

Yes I am giddy. Go on!

Thats all. Sign it.

The head clerk took the paper and turned to attend to others.

Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away
he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. He
felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull. A strange idea
suddenly occurred to him to get up at once to go up to Nikodim
Fomitch and tell him everything that had happened yesterday and then
to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole
in the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat
to carry it out. Hadnt I better think a minute? flashed through his
mind. No better cast off the burden without thinking. But all at once
he stood still rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly
with Ilya Petrovitch and the words reached him:

Its impossible theyll both be released. To begin with the whole
story contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter if it
had been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No
that would be too cunning! Besides Pestryakov the student was seen at
the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking
with three friends who left him only at the gate and he asked the
porters to direct him in the presence of the friends. Now would he
have asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As for
Koch he spent half an hour at the silversmiths below before he went
up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now
just consider...

But excuse me how do you explain this contradiction? They state
themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes
later when they went up with the porter it turned out the door was
unfastened.

Thats just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself
in; and theyd have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been
an ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the
interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing
himself and saying: If I had been there he would have jumped out and
killed me with his axe. He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha
ha!

And no one saw the murderer?

They might well not see him; the house is a regular Noahs Ark said
the head clerk who was listening.

Its clear quite clear Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly.

No it is anything but clear Ilya Petrovitch maintained.

Raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door but he did
not reach it....

When he recovered consciousness he found himself sitting in a chair
supported by someone on the right side while someone else was standing
on the left holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water and
Nikodim Fomitch standing before him looking intently at him. He got up
from the chair.

Whats this? Are you ill? Nikodim Fomitch asked rather sharply.

He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing said the head clerk
settling back in his place and taking up his work again.

Have you been ill long? cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place where
he too was looking through papers. He had of course come to look at
the sick man when he fainted but retired at once when he recovered.

Since yesterday muttered Raskolnikov in reply.

Did you go out yesterday?

Yes.

Though you were ill?

Yes.

At what time?

About seven.

And where did you go may I ask?

Along the street.

Short and clear.

Raskolnikov white as a handkerchief had answered sharply jerkily
without dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitchs stare.

He can scarcely stand upright. And you... Nikodim Fomitch was
beginning.

No matter Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly.

Nikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest but glancing at
the head clerk who was looking very hard at him he did not speak. There
was a sudden silence. It was strange.

Very well then concluded Ilya Petrovitch we will not detain you.

Raskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager conversation on his
departure and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim
Fomitch. In the street his faintness passed off completely.

A search--there will be a search at once he repeated to himself
hurrying home. The brutes! they suspect.

His former terror mastered him completely again.



CHAPTER II

And what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my
room?

But here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in.
Even Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have left
all those things in the hole?

He rushed to the corner slipped his hand under the paper pulled the
things out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles in
all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort he hardly
looked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain too
merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper that looked
like a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of his
overcoat and the remaining pocket of his trousers trying to conceal
them as much as possible. He took the purse too. Then he went out of
his room leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely and
though he felt shattered he had his senses about him. He was afraid of
pursuit he was afraid that in another half-hour another quarter of an
hour perhaps instructions would be issued for his pursuit and so at
all costs he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything
up while he still had some strength some reasoning power left him....
Where was he to go?

That had long been settled: Fling them into the canal and all traces
hidden in the water the thing would be at an end. So he had decided in
the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to
get up and go away to make haste and get rid of it all. But to get
rid of it turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along
the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked
several times at the steps running down to the water but he could not
think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps edge
and women were washing clothes on them or boats were moored there and
people were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed
from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go
down on purpose stop and throw something into the water. And what if
the boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.
Even as it was everyone he met seemed to stare and look round as if
they had nothing to do but to watch him. Why is it or can it be my
fancy? he thought.

At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the
Neva. There were not so many people there he would be less observed
and it would be more convenient in every way above all it was further
off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour
worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it
before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan simply
because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent
and forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.

He walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect but on the way
another idea struck him. Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to go
somewhere far off to the Islands again and there hide the things
in some solitary place in a wood or under a bush and mark the spot
perhaps? And though he felt incapable of clear judgment the idea
seemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For
coming out of V---- Prospect towards the square he saw on the left a
passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right
hand the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far
into the court; on the left a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for
twenty paces into the court and then turned sharply to the left. Here
was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was
lying. At the end of the court the corner of a low smutty stone shed
apparently part of some workshop peeped from behind the hoarding. It
was probably a carriage builders or carpenters shed; the whole place
from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to
throw it he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard he slipped in and
at once saw near the gate a sink such as is often put in yards where
there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had
been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism Standing here
strictly forbidden. This was all the better for there would be nothing
suspicious about his going in. Here I could throw it all in a heap and
get away!

Looking round once more with his hand already in his pocket he noticed
against the outer wall between the entrance and the sink a big unhewn
stone weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a
street. He could hear passers-by always numerous in that part but he
could not be seen from the entrance unless someone came in from the
street which might well happen indeed so there was need of haste.

He bent down over the stone seized the top of it firmly in both hands
and using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small
hollow in the ground and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.
The purse lay at the top and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he
seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back so that it was
in the same position again though it stood a very little higher. But
he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.
Nothing could be noticed.

Then he went out and turned into the square. Again an intense
almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant as it had in
the police-office. I have buried my tracks! And who who can think of
looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since
the house was built and will lie as many years more. And if it were
found who would think of me? It is all over! No clue! And he laughed.
Yes he remembered that he began laughing a thin nervous noiseless
laugh and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But
when he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come
upon that girl his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his
mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat
on which after the girl was gone he had sat and pondered and that it
would be hateful too to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had
given the twenty copecks: Damn him!

He walked looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now
seemed to be circling round some single point and he felt that there
really was such a point and that now now he was left facing that
point--and for the first time indeed during the last two months.

Damn it all! he thought suddenly in a fit of ungovernable fury.
If it has begun then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord how
stupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned
upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I
care for them all and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It
is not that at all!

Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple
question perplexed and bitterly confounded him.

If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically if
I really had a certain and definite object how is it I did not even
glance into the purse and dont know what I had there for which I have
undergone these agonies and have deliberately undertaken this base
filthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the
water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen
either... hows that?

Yes that was so that was all so. Yet he had known it all before and
it was not a new question for him even when it was decided in the night
without hesitation and consideration as though so it must be as though
it could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes he had known it all and
understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the
moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out
of it.... Yes so it was.

It is because I am very ill he decided grimly at last I have been
worrying and fretting myself and I dont know what I am doing....
Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been
worrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what
if I dont get well at all? Good God how sick I am of it all!

He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some
distraction but he did not know what to do what to attempt. A new
overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him
every moment; this was an immeasurable almost physical repulsion for
everything surrounding him an obstinate malignant feeling of hatred.
All who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces their
movements their gestures. If anyone had addressed him he felt that he
might have spat at him or bitten him....

He stopped suddenly on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva near
the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. Why he lives here in that house
 he thought why I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here
its the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know though;
have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never
mind I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the
day _after_; well and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further
now.

He went up to Razumihins room on the fifth floor.

The latter was at home in his garret busily writing at the moment and
he opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each
other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown with slippers on
his bare feet unkempt unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.

Is it you? he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a
brief pause he whistled. As hard up as all that! Why brother youve
cut me out! he added looking at Raskolnikovs rags. Come sit down
you are tired Ill be bound.

And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa which was
in even worse condition than his own Razumihin saw at once that his
visitor was ill.

Why you are seriously ill do you know that? He began feeling his
pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.

Never mind he said I have come for this: I have no lessons.... I
wanted... but I dont really want lessons....

But I say! You are delirious you know! Razumihin observed watching
him carefully.

No I am not.

Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to
Razumihins he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend
face to face. Now in a flash he knew that what he was least of all
disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the
wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at
himself as soon as he crossed Razumihins threshold.

Good-bye he said abruptly and walked to the door.

Stop stop! You queer fish.

I dont want to said the other again pulling away his hand.

Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad or what? Why this
is... almost insulting! I wont let you go like that.

Well then I came to you because I know no one but you who could
help... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer I
mean and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?
Nothing at all... no ones services... no ones sympathy. I am by
myself... alone. Come thats enough. Leave me alone.

Stay a minute you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all
I care. I have no lessons do you see and I dont care about that but
theres a bookseller Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.
I would not exchange him for five lessons. Hes doing publishing of a
kind and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they
have! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I
was a fool but by Jove my boy there are greater fools than I am!
Now he is setting up for being advanced not that he has an inkling of
anything but of course I encourage him. Here are two signatures of
the German text--in my opinion the crudest charlatanism; it discusses
the question Is woman a human being? And of course triumphantly
proves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a
contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand
these two and a half signatures into six we shall make up a gorgeous
title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He
pays me six roubles the signature it works out to about fifteen roubles
for the job and Ive had six already in advance. When we have finished
this we are going to begin a translation about whales and then some of
the dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have
marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov that Rousseau was
a kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I dont contradict him hang him!
Well would you like to do the second signature of _Is woman a human
being?_ If you would take the German and pens and paper--all those
are provided and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in
advance on the whole thing three roubles come to you for your share.
And when you have finished the signature there will be another three
roubles for you. And please dont think I am doing you a service; quite
the contrary as soon as you came in I saw how you could help me; to
begin with I am weak in spelling and secondly I am sometimes utterly
adrift in German so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.
The only comfort is that its bound to be a change for the better.
Though who can tell maybe its sometimes for the worse. Will you take
it?

Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence took the three roubles
and without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.
But when Raskolnikov was in the next street he turned back mounted the
stairs to Razumihins again and laying on the table the German article
and the three roubles went out again still without uttering a word.

Are you raving or what? Razumihin shouted roused to fury at last.
What farce is this? Youll drive me crazy too... what did you come to
see me for damn you?

I dont want... translation muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.

Then what the devil do you want? shouted Razumihin from above.
Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.

Hey there! Where are you living?

No answer.

Well confound you then!

But Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky
Bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant
incident. A coachman after shouting at him two or three times gave him
a violent lash on the back with his whip for having almost fallen under
his horses hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the
railing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle
of the bridge in the traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.
He heard laughter of course.

Serves him right!

A pickpocket I dare say.

Pretending to be drunk for sure and getting under the wheels on
purpose; and you have to answer for him.

Its a regular profession thats what it is.

But while he stood at the railing still looking angry and bewildered
after the retreating carriage and rubbing his back he suddenly felt
someone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman
in a kerchief and goatskin shoes with a girl probably her daughter
wearing a hat and carrying a green parasol.

Take it my good man in Christs name.

He took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. From
his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar
asking alms in the streets and the gift of the twenty copecks he
doubtless owed to the blow which made them feel sorry for him.

He closed his hand on the twenty copecks walked on for ten paces and
turned facing the Neva looking towards the palace. The sky was without
a cloud and the water was almost bright blue which is so rare in the
Neva. The cupola of the cathedral which is seen at its best from the
bridge about twenty paces from the chapel glittered in the sunlight
and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.
The pain from the lash went off and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one
uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood
still and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was
especially familiar to him. When he was attending the university he had
hundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot
gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at
a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely
cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered
every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and mistrusting
himself put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled
those old doubts and perplexities and it seemed to him that it was
no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and
grotesque that he should have stopped at the same spot as before
as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts be
interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...
so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing and yet it wrung his
heart. Deep down hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him
now--all his old past his old thoughts his old problems and theories
his old impressions and that picture and himself and all all.... He
felt as though he were flying upwards and everything were vanishing
from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand he
suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his
hand stared at the coin and with a sweep of his arm flung it into
the water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him he had cut
himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.

Evening was coming on when he reached home so that he must have been
walking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.
Undressing and quivering like an overdriven horse he lay down on the
sofa drew his greatcoat over him and at once sank into oblivion....

It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God what a
scream! Such unnatural sounds such howling wailing grinding tears
blows and curses he had never heard.

He could never have imagined such brutality such frenzy. In terror he
sat up in bed almost swooning with agony. But the fighting wailing
and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement
he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling shrieking and
wailing rapidly hurriedly incoherently so that he could not make
out what she was talking about; she was beseeching no doubt not to be
beaten for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of
her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost
a croak; but he too was saying something and just as quickly
and indistinctly hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov
trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.
Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her
banging her head against the steps--thats clear that can be told
from the sounds from the cries and the thuds. How is it is the world
topsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys
and all the staircases; he heard voices exclamations knocking doors
banging. But why why and how could it be? he repeated thinking
seriously that he had gone mad. But no he heard too distinctly! And
they would come to him then next for no doubt... its all about
that... about yesterday.... Good God! He would have fastened his door
with the latch but he could not lift his hand... besides it would
be useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice tortured him and numbed
him.... But at last all this uproar after continuing about ten minutes
began gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya
Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he
too seemed to be silent and now he could not be heard. Can he have
gone away? Good Lord! Yes and now the landlady is going too still
weeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was
going from the stairs to their rooms exclaiming disputing calling
to one another raising their voices to a shout dropping them to a
whisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates
of the block. But good God how could it be! And why why had he come
here!

Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa but could not close his eyes. He
lay for half an hour in such anguish such an intolerable sensation of
infinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright
light flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate
of soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not
asleep she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she
had brought--bread salt a plate a spoon.

Youve eaten nothing since yesterday I warrant. Youve been trudging
about all day and youre shaking with fever.

Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?

She looked intently at him.

Who beat the landlady?

Just now... half an hour ago Ilya Petrovitch the assistant
superintendent on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that
and... why was he here?

Nastasya scrutinised him silent and frowning and her scrutiny lasted a
long time. He felt uneasy even frightened at her searching eyes.

Nastasya why dont you speak? he said timidly at last in a weak
voice.

Its the blood she answered at last softly as though speaking to
herself.

Blood? What blood? he muttered growing white and turning towards the
wall.

Nastasya still looked at him without speaking.

Nobody has been beating the landlady she declared at last in a firm
resolute voice.

He gazed at her hardly able to breathe.

I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up he
said still more timidly. I listened a long while. The assistant
superintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the
flats.

No one has been here. Thats the blood crying in your ears. When
theres no outlet for it and it gets clotted you begin fancying
things.... Will you eat something?

He made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him watching him.

Give me something to drink... Nastasya.

She went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.
He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling
some on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.



CHAPTER III

He was not completely unconscious however all the time he was ill; he
was in a feverish state sometimes delirious sometimes half conscious.
He remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though
there were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away
somewhere there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about
him. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid
of him and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;
they threatened him plotted something together laughed and mocked
at him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished
another person too whom he seemed to know very well though he could
not remember who he was and this fretted him even made him cry.
Sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times
it all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he had
no recollection and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten
something he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself trying
to remember moaned flew into a rage or sank into awful intolerable
terror. Then he struggled to get up would have run away but someone
always prevented him by force and he sank back into impotence and
forgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.

It happened at ten oclock in the morning. On fine days the sun shone
into the room at that hour throwing a streak of light on the right
wall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside him
with another person a complete stranger who was looking at him
very inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard wearing a full
short-waisted coat and looked like a messenger. The landlady was
peeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.

Who is this Nastasya? he asked pointing to the young man.

I say hes himself again! she said.

He is himself echoed the man.

Concluding that he had returned to his senses the landlady closed the
door and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations or
discussions. She was a woman of forty not at all bad-looking fat
and buxom with black eyes and eyebrows good-natured from fatness and
laziness and absurdly bashful.

Who... are you? he went on addressing the man. But at that moment
the door was flung open and stooping a little as he was so tall
Razumihin came in.

What a cabin it is! he cried. I am always knocking my head. You call
this a lodging! So you are conscious brother? Ive just heard the news
from Pashenka.

He has just come to said Nastasya.

Just come to echoed the man again with a smile.

And who are you? Razumihin asked suddenly addressing him. My name is
Vrazumihin at your service; not Razumihin as I am always called but
Vrazumihin a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are
you?

I am the messenger from our office from the merchant Shelopaev and
Ive come on business.

Please sit down. Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the
table. Its a good thing youve come to brother he went on to
Raskolnikov. For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk
anything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see
you twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said at
once it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.
Some nervous nonsense the result of bad feeding he says you have not
had enough beer and radish but its nothing much it will pass and you
will be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a
name. Come I wont keep you he said addressing the man again. Will
you explain what you want? You must know Rodya this is the second time
they have sent from the office; but it was another man last time and I
talked to him. Who was it came before?

That was the day before yesterday I venture to say if you please
sir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office too.

He was more intelligent than you dont you think so?

Yes indeed sir he is of more weight than I am.

Quite so; go on.

At your mammas request through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin of whom
I presume you have heard more than once a remittance is sent to you
from our office the man began addressing Raskolnikov. If you are in
an intelligible condition Ive thirty-five roubles to remit to you as
Semyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mammas
request instructions to that effect as on previous occasions. Do you
know him sir?

Yes I remember... Vahrushin Raskolnikov said dreamily.

You hear he knows Vahrushin cried Razumihin. He is in an
intelligible condition! And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well
its always pleasant to hear words of wisdom.

Thats the gentleman Vahrushin Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the request
of your mamma who has sent you a remittance once before in the
same manner through him he did not refuse this time also and sent
instructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you
thirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come.

That hoping for better to come is the best thing youve said though
your mamma is not bad either. Come then what do you say? Is he fully
conscious eh?

Thats all right. If only he can sign this little paper.

He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?

Yes heres the book.

Give it to me. Here Rodya sit up. Ill hold you. Take the pen and
scribble Raskolnikov for him. For just now brother money is sweeter
to us than treacle.

I dont want it said Raskolnikov pushing away the pen.

Not want it?

I wont sign it.

How the devil can you do without signing it?

I dont want... the money.

Dont want the money! Come brother thats nonsense I bear witness.
Dont trouble please its only that he is on his travels again. But
thats pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of
judgment and we will take him in hand that is more simply take his
hand and he will sign it. Here.

But I can come another time.

No no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now
Rodya dont keep your visitor you see he is waiting and he made
ready to hold Raskolnikovs hand in earnest.

Stop Ill do it alone said the latter taking the pen and signing
his name.

The messenger took out the money and went away.

Bravo! And now brother are you hungry?

Yes answered Raskolnikov.

Is there any soup?

Some of yesterdays answered Nastasya who was still standing there.

With potatoes and rice in it?

Yes.

I know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some tea.

Very well.

Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull
unreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what
would happen. I believe I am not wandering. I believe its reality he
thought.

In a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup and announced
that the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought two
spoons two plates salt pepper mustard for the beef and so on. The
table was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.

It would not be amiss Nastasya if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us
up a couple of bottles of beer. We could empty them.

Well you are a cool hand muttered Nastasya and she departed to
carry out his orders.

Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. Meanwhile
Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him as clumsily as a bear put his
left arm round Raskolnikovs head although he was able to sit up and
with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup blowing on it that
it might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov
swallowed one spoonful greedily then a second then a third. But after
giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup Razumihin suddenly stopped and
said that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.

Nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.

And will you have tea?

Yes.

Cut along Nastasya and bring some tea for tea we may venture on
without the faculty. But here is the beer! He moved back to his chair
pulled the soup and meat in front of him and began eating as though he
had not touched food for three days.

I must tell you Rodya I dine like this here every day now he
mumbled with his mouth full of beef and its all Pashenka your dear
little landlady who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. I
dont ask for it but of course I dont object. And heres Nastasya
with the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya my dear wont you have
some beer?

Get along with your nonsense!

A cup of tea then?

A cup of tea maybe.

Pour it out. Stay Ill pour it out myself. Sit down.

He poured out two cups left his dinner and sat on the sofa again. As
before he put his left arm round the sick mans head raised him up
and gave him tea in spoonfuls again blowing each spoonful steadily and
earnestly as though this process was the principal and most effective
means towards his friends recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made
no resistance though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa
without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon but
even perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer almost
animal cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying
low for a time pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession
of his faculties and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.
Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen
spoonfuls of tea he suddenly released his head pushed the spoon away
capriciously and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real
pillows under his head now down pillows in clean cases he observed
that too and took note of it.

Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some
raspberry tea said Razumihin going back to his chair and attacking
his soup and beer again.

And where is she to get raspberries for you? asked Nastasya balancing
a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of
sugar.

Shell get it at the shop my dear. You see Rodya all sorts of things
have been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in
that rascally way without leaving your address I felt so angry that I
resolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.
How I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had
forgotten though I never remembered it indeed because I did not know
it; and as for your old lodgings I could only remember it was at the
Five Corners Harlamovs house. I kept trying to find that Harlamovs
house and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamovs but
Buchs. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper and I
went on the chance to the address bureau next day and only fancy in
two minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there.

My name!

I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while
I was there. Well its a long story. But as soon as I did land on this
place I soon got to know all your affairs--all all brother I know
everything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance of
Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch and the house-porter and Mr.
Zametov Alexandr Grigorievitch the head clerk in the police office
and last but not least of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows....

Hes got round her Nastasya murmured smiling slyly.

Why dont you put the sugar in your tea Nastasya Nikiforovna?

You are a one! Nastasya cried suddenly going off into a giggle. I am
not Nikiforovna but Petrovna she added suddenly recovering from her
mirth.

Ill make a note of it. Well brother to make a long story short
I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant
influences in the locality but Pashenka won the day. I had not
expected brother to find her so... prepossessing. Eh what do you
think?

Raskolnikov did not speak but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him
full of alarm.

And all that could be wished indeed in every respect Razumihin went
on not at all embarrassed by his silence.

Ah the sly dog! Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation afforded
her unspeakable delight.

Its a pity brother that you did not set to work in the right way
at first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is so
to speak a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her
character later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that
she gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been
mad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter
Natalya Yegorovna was alive?... I know all about it! But I see thats
a delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But talking of
foolishness do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as
you would think at first sight?

No mumbled Raskolnikov looking away but feeling that it was better
to keep up the conversation.

She isnt is she? cried Razumihin delighted to get an answer out
of him. But she is not very clever either eh? She is essentially
essentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss
I assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six and
of course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge her
intellectually simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a
sort of symbolism sprung up between us a sort of algebra or what not!
I dont understand it! Well thats all nonsense. Only seeing that you
are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes and
that through the young ladys death she has no need to treat you as
a relation she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and
dropped all your old relations with her she planned to get rid of you.
And shes been cherishing that design a long time but was sorry to lose
the I O U for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay.

It was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost
a beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed
 Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.

Yes you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point
Mr. Tchebarov turns up a business man. Pashenka would never have
thought of doing anything on her own account she is too retiring; but
the business man is by no means retiring and first thing he puts the
question Is there any hope of realising the I O U? Answer: there is
because he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and
twenty-five roubles pension if she has to starve herself; and a sister
too who would go into bondage for his sake. Thats what he was building
upon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs
now my dear boy--its not for nothing that you were so open with
Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law and I say all this as
a friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is
open; and a business man listens and goes on eating you up. Well
then she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov and without
hesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all this
I wanted to blow him up too to clear my conscience but by that time
harmony reigned between me and Pashenka and I insisted on stopping
the whole affair engaging that you would pay. I went security for you
brother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov flung him ten
roubles and got the I O U back from him and here I have the honour of
presenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here take it you see I
have torn it.

Razumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him and
turned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt a
twinge.

I see brother he said a moment later that I have been playing the
fool again. I thought I should amuse you with my chatter and I believe
I have only made you cross.

Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious? Raskolnikov
asked after a moments pause without turning his head.

Yes and you flew into a rage about it especially when I brought
Zametov one day.

Zametov? The head clerk? What for? Raskolnikov turned round quickly
and fixed his eyes on Razumihin.

Whats the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to
make your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How
could I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital
fellow brother first-rate... in his own way of course. Now we are
friends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part
you know. I have only just moved. Ive been with him to Luise Ivanovna
once or twice.... Do you remember Luise Luise Ivanovna?

Did I say anything in delirium?

I should think so! You were beside yourself.

What did I rave about?

What next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well
brother now I must not lose time. To work. He got up from the table
and took up his cap.

What did I rave about?

How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Dont
worry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lot
about a bulldog and about ear-rings and chains and about Krestovsky
Island and some porter and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch the
assistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interest
to you was your own sock. You whined Give me my sock. Zametov
hunted all about your room for your socks and with his own scented
ring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were you
comforted and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched
thing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely
somewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so
piteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sort
of fringe but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here are
thirty-five roubles; I take ten of them and shall give you an account
of them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time
though he ought to have been here long ago for it is nearly twelve. And
you Nastasya look in pretty often while I am away to see whether he
wants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted
myself. Good-bye!

He calls her Pashenka! Ah hes a deep one! said Nastasya as he went
out; then she opened the door and stood listening but could not resist
running downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would
say to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.

No sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the
bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning twitching
impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to
work. But to what work? Now as though to spite him it eluded him.

Good God only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What
if they know it and are only pretending mocking me while I am laid up
and then they will come in and tell me that its been discovered long
ago and that they have only... What am I to do now? Thats what Ive
forgotten as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once I remembered
a minute ago.

He stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment
about him; he walked to the door opened it listened; but that was not
what he wanted. Suddenly as though recalling something he rushed to
the corner where there was a hole under the paper began examining it
put his hand into the hole fumbled--but that was not it. He went to the
stove opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of
his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as
he had thrown them. No one had looked then! Then he remembered the sock
about which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes there it lay on
the sofa under the quilt but it was so covered with dust and grime that
Zametov could not have seen anything on it.

Bah Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the police
office? Wheres the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I
looked at my sock then too but now... now I have been ill. But
what did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him? he muttered
helplessly sitting on the sofa again. What does it mean? Am I still in
delirium or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah I remember; I must
escape! Make haste to escape. Yes I must I must escape! Yes... but
where? And where are my clothes? Ive no boots. Theyve taken them away!
Theyve hidden them! I understand! Ah here is my coat--they passed that
over! And here is money on the table thank God! And heres the I O U...
Ill take the money and go and take another lodging. They wont find
me!... Yes but the address bureau? Theyll find me Razumihin will find
me. Better escape altogether... far away... to America and let them
do their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What
else shall I take? They think I am ill! They dont know that I can walk
ha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If
only I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch
there--policemen! Whats this tea? Ah and here is beer left half a
bottle cold!

He snatched up the bottle which still contained a glassful of beer and
gulped it down with relish as though quenching a flame in his breast.
But in another minute the beer had gone to his head and a faint and
even pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the
quilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more
disconnected and soon a light pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With
a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow wrapped more
closely about him the soft wadded quilt which had replaced the old
ragged greatcoat sighed softly and sank into a deep sound refreshing
sleep.

He woke up hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and saw
Razumihin standing in the doorway uncertain whether to come in or
not. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him as though
trying to recall something.

Ah you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya bring in the parcel!
 Razumihin shouted down the stairs. You shall have the account
directly.

What time is it? asked Raskolnikov looking round uneasily.

Yes you had a fine sleep brother its almost evening it will be six
oclock directly. You have slept more than six hours.

Good heavens! Have I?

And why not? It will do you good. Whats the hurry? A tryst is it?
Weve all time before us. Ive been waiting for the last three hours for
you; Ive been up twice and found you asleep. Ive called on Zossimov
twice; not at home only fancy! But no matter he will turn up. And
Ive been out on my own business too. You know Ive been moving to-day
moving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But thats
no matter to business. Give me the parcel Nastasya. We will open it
directly. And how do you feel now brother?

I am quite well I am not ill. Razumihin have you been here long?

I tell you Ive been waiting for the last three hours.

No before.

How do you mean?

How long have you been coming here?

Why I told you all about it this morning. Dont you remember?

Raskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He could
not remember alone and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.

Hm! said the latter he has forgotten. I fancied then that you were
not quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really
look much better. First-rate! Well to business. Look here my dear
boy.

He began untying the bundle which evidently interested him.

Believe me brother this is something specially near my heart. For we
must make a man of you. Lets begin from the top. Do you see this
cap? he said taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and
ordinary cap. Let me try it on.

Presently afterwards said Raskolnikov waving it off pettishly.

Come Rodya my boy dont oppose it afterwards will be too late; and
I shant sleep all night for I bought it by guess without measure.
Just right! he cried triumphantly fitting it on just your size! A
proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in
its own way. Tolstyakov a friend of mine is always obliged to take off
his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other
people wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavish
politeness but its simply because he is ashamed of his birds nest;
he is such a boastful fellow! Look Nastasya here are two specimens of
headgear: this Palmerston--he took from the corner Raskolnikovs old
battered hat which for some unknown reason he called a Palmerston--or
this jewel! Guess the price Rodya what do you suppose I paid for it
Nastasya! he said turning to her seeing that Raskolnikov did not
speak.

Twenty copecks no more I dare say answered Nastasya.

Twenty copecks silly! he cried offended. Why nowadays you would
cost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has been
worn. And its bought on condition that whens its worn out they will
give you another next year. Yes on my word! Well now let us pass to
the United States of America as they called them at school. I assure
you I am proud of these breeches and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a
pair of light summer trousers of grey woollen material. No holes no
spots and quite respectable although a little worn; and a waistcoat
to match quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is an
improvement its softer smoother.... You see Rodya to my thinking
the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the
seasons; if you dont insist on having asparagus in January you keep
your money in your purse; and its the same with this purchase. Its
summer now so Ive been buying summer things--warmer materials will be
wanted for autumn so you will have to throw these away in any case...
especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of
coherence if not your higher standard of luxury. Come price them! What
do you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:
if you wear these out you will have another suit for nothing! They only
do business on that system at Fedyaevs; if youve bought a thing once
you are satisfied for life for you will never go there again of your
own free will. Now for the boots. What do you say? You see that they are
a bit worn but theyll last a couple of months for its foreign work
and foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last
week--he had only worn them six days but he was very short of cash.
Price--a rouble and a half. A bargain?

But perhaps they wont fit observed Nastasya.

Not fit? Just look! and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikovs
old broken boot stiffly coated with dry mud. I did not go
empty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best.
And as to your linen your landlady has seen to that. Here to begin
with are three shirts hempen but with a fashionable front.... Well
now then eighty copecks the cap two roubles twenty-five copecks the
suit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the
boots--for you see they are very good--and that makes four roubles
fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were
bought in the lot--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.
Forty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so Rodya
you are set up with a complete new rig-out for your overcoat will
serve and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting ones
clothes from Sharmers! As for your socks and other things I leave them
to you; weve twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and paying
for your lodging dont you worry. I tell you shell trust you for
anything. And now brother let me change your linen for I daresay you
will throw off your illness with your shirt.

Let me be! I dont want to! Raskolnikov waved him off. He had listened
with disgust to Razumihins efforts to be playful about his purchases.

Come brother dont tell me Ive been trudging around for nothing
 Razumihin insisted. Nastasya dont be bashful but help me--thats
it and in spite of Raskolnikovs resistance he changed his linen. The
latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.

It will be long before I get rid of them he thought. What money was
all that bought with? he asked at last gazing at the wall.

Money? Why your own what the messenger brought from Vahrushin your
mother sent it. Have you forgotten that too?

I remember now said Raskolnikov after a long sullen silence.
Razumihin looked at him frowning and uneasy.

The door opened and a tall stout man whose appearance seemed familiar
to Raskolnikov came in.



CHAPTER IV

Zossimov was a tall fat man with a puffy colourless clean-shaven face
and straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles and a big gold ring on
his fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable
loose coat light summer trousers and everything about him loose
fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable his
watch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and as it were
nonchalant and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made
efforts to conceal his self-importance but it was apparent at every
instant. All his acquaintances found him tedious but said he was clever
at his work.

Ive been to you twice to-day brother. You see hes come to himself
 cried Razumihin.

I see I see; and how do we feel now eh? said Zossimov to
Raskolnikov watching him carefully and sitting down at the foot of the
sofa he settled himself as comfortably as he could.

He is still depressed Razumihin went on. Weve just changed his
linen and he almost cried.

Thats very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish
it.... His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching eh?

I am well I am perfectly well! Raskolnikov declared positively
and irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with
glittering eyes but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to
the wall. Zossimov watched him intently.

Very good.... Going on all right he said lazily. Has he eaten
anything?

They told him and asked what he might have.

He may have anything... soup tea... mushrooms and cucumbers of
course you must not give him; hed better not have meat either and...
but no need to tell you that! Razumihin and he looked at each
other. No more medicine or anything. Ill look at him again to-morrow.
Perhaps to-day even... but never mind...

To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk said Razumihin. We are
going to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Cristal.

I would not disturb him to-morrow at all but I dont know... a little
maybe... but well see.

Ach what a nuisance! Ive got a house-warming party to-night; its
only a step from here. Couldnt he come? He could lie on the sofa. You
are coming? Razumihin said to Zossimov. Dont forget you promised.

All right only rather later. What are you going to do?

Oh nothing--tea vodka herrings. There will be a pie... just our
friends.

And who?

All neighbours here almost all new friends except my old uncle and
he is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some
business of his. We meet once in five years.

What is he?

Hes been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a
little pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about.... But I
am fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch the head of the Investigation
Department here... But you know him.

Is he a relation of yours too?

A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelled
once wont you come then?

I dont care a damn for him.

So much the better. Well there will be some students a teacher a
government clerk a musician an officer and Zametov.

Do tell me please what you or he--Zossimov nodded at
Raskolnikov--can have in common with this Zametov?

Oh you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles
as it were by springs; you wont venture to turn round on your own
account. If a man is a nice fellow thats the only principle I go upon.
Zametov is a delightful person.

Though he does take bribes.

Well he does! and what of it? I dont care if he does take bribes
 Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. I dont praise him for
taking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one
looks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why I am sure
I shouldnt be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown
in.

Thats too little; Id give two for you.

And I wouldnt give more than one for you. No more of your jokes!
Zametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw him
not repel him. Youll never improve a man by repelling him especially
a boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh you progressive
dullards! You dont understand. You harm yourselves running another man
down.... But if you want to know we really have something in common.

I should like to know what.

Why its all about a house-painter.... We are getting him out of
a mess! Though indeed theres nothing to fear now. The matter is
absolutely self-evident. We only put on steam.

A painter?

Why havent I told you about it? I only told you the beginning then
about the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman. Well the painter is mixed
up in it...

Oh I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...
partly... for one reason.... I read about it in the papers too....

Lizaveta was murdered too Nastasya blurted out suddenly addressing
Raskolnikov. She remained in the room all the time standing by the door
listening.

Lizaveta murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly.

Lizaveta who sold old clothes. Didnt you know her? She used to come
here. She mended a shirt for you too.

Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty yellow paper he
picked out one clumsy white flower with brown lines on it and began
examining how many petals there were in it how many scallops in the
petals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless
as though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move but stared
obstinately at the flower.

But what about the painter? Zossimov interrupted Nastasyas chatter
with marked displeasure. She sighed and was silent.

Why he was accused of the murder Razumihin went on hotly.

Was there evidence against him then?

Evidence indeed! Evidence that was no evidence and thats what we
have to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows Koch and
Pestryakov at first. Foo! how stupidly its all done it makes one
sick though its not ones business! Pestryakov may be coming
to-night.... By the way Rodya youve heard about the business already;
it happened before you were ill the day before you fainted at the
police office while they were talking about it.

Zossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not stir.

But I say Razumihin I wonder at you. What a busybody you are!
 Zossimov observed.

Maybe I am but we will get him off anyway shouted Razumihin
bringing his fist down on the table. Whats the most offensive is not
their lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing
for it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship
their own lying.... I respect Porfiry but... What threw them out at
first? The door was locked and when they came back with the porter
it was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the
murderers--that was their logic!

But dont excite yourself; they simply detained them they could not
help that.... And by the way Ive met that man Koch. He used to buy
unredeemed pledges from the old woman? Eh?

Yes he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts too. He makes a profession
of it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? Its their
sickening rotten petrified routine.... And this case might be the means
of introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data
alone how to get on the track of the real man. We have facts they
say. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in
how you interpret them!

Can you interpret them then?

Anyway one cant hold ones tongue when one has a feeling a tangible
feeling that one might be a help if only.... Eh! Do you know the
details of the case?

I am waiting to hear about the painter.

Oh yes! Well heres the story. Early on the third day after the
murder when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they
accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an
unexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin who keeps a
dram-shop facing the house brought to the police office a jewellers
case containing some gold ear-rings and told a long rigamarole. The
day before yesterday just after eight oclock--mark the day and the
hour!--a journeyman house-painter Nikolay who had been in to see me
already that day brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones and
asked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got
them he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him
anything more. I am telling you Dushkins story. I gave him a note--a
rouble that is--for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would
with another. It would all come to the same thing--hed spend it on
drink so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it
the quicker you will find it and if anything turns up if I hear any
rumours Ill take it to the police. Of course thats all taradiddle;
he lies like a horse for I know this Dushkin he is a pawnbroker and
a receiver of stolen goods and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a
thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply
afraid. But no matter to return to Dushkins story. Ive known
this peasant Nikolay Dementyev from a child; he comes from the same
province and district of Zarask we are both Ryazan men. And though
Nikolay is not a drunkard he drinks and I knew he had a job in that
house painting work with Dmitri who comes from the same village too.
As soon as he got the rouble he changed it had a couple of glasses
took his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.
And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and
her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna with an axe. I knew them and I felt
suspicious about the ear-rings at once for I knew the murdered woman
lent money on pledges. I went to the house and began to make careful
inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked Is
Nikolay here? Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he
had come home at daybreak drunk stayed in the house about ten minutes
and went out again. Dmitri didnt see him again and is finishing the
job alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder on
the second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to
anyone--thats Dushkins tale--but I found out what I could about
the murder and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight
oclock this morning--that was the third day you understand--I saw
Nikolay coming in not sober though not to say very drunk--he could
understand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not
speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep
on a bench and our two boys. Have you seen Dmitri? said I. No I
havent said he. And youve not been here either? Not since the day
before yesterday said he. And where did you sleep last night?
 In Peski with the Kolomensky men. And where did you get those
ear-rings? I asked. I found them in the street and the way he said
it was a bit queer; he did not look at me. Did you hear what happened
that very evening at that very hour on that same staircase? said I.
No said he I had not heard and all the while he was listening
his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I
told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted
to keep him. Wait a bit Nikolay said I wont you have a drink?
 And I signed to the boy to hold the door and I came out from behind the
bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.
I have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his
doing as clear as could be....

I should think so said Zossimov.

Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;
they detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri too was arrested;
the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before
yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He
had gone there taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram
for it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went
to the cowshed and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable
adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam stood on a
block of wood and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman
screeched her hardest; people ran in. So thats what you are up to!
Take me he says to such-and-such a police officer; Ill confess
everything. Well they took him to that police station--that is
here--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that how old
he is twenty-two and so on. At the question When you were working
with Dmitri didnt you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a
time?--answer: To be sure folks may have gone up and down but I did
not notice them. And didnt you hear anything any noise and so on?
We heard nothing special. And did you hear Nikolay that on the same
day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed? I
never knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy
Pavlovitch the day before yesterday. And where did you find the
ear-rings? I found them on the pavement. Why didnt you go to work
with Dmitri the other day? Because I was drinking. And where were
you drinking? Oh in such-and-such a place. Why did you run away
from Dushkins? Because I was awfully frightened. What were
you frightened of? That I should be accused. How could you be
frightened if you felt free from guilt? Now Zossimov you may not
believe me that question was put literally in those words. I know it
for a fact it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?

Well anyway theres the evidence.

I am not talking of the evidence now I am talking about that question
of their own idea of themselves. Well so they squeezed and squeezed
him and he confessed: I did not find it in the street but in the flat
where I was painting with Dmitri. And how was that? Why Dmitri and
I were painting there all day and we were just getting ready to go and
Dmitri took a brush and painted my face and he ran off and I after him.
I ran after him shouting my hardest and at the bottom of the stairs I
ran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen
were there I dont remember. And the porter swore at me and the other
porter swore too and the porters wife came out and swore at us too;
and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady and he swore at us
too for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitris
hair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri too caught
me by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper
but in a friendly way for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into
the street and I ran after him; but I did not catch him and went back
to the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them
together expecting Dmitri to come and there in the passage in the
corner by the door I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped
up in paper. I took off the paper saw some little hooks undid them
and in the box were the ear-rings....

Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door? Raskolnikov
cried suddenly staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin and he
slowly sat up on the sofa leaning on his hand.

Yes... why? Whats the matter? Whats wrong? Razumihin too got up
from his seat.

Nothing Raskolnikov answered faintly turning to the wall. All were
silent for a while.

He must have waked from a dream Razumihin said at last looking
inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.

Well go on said Zossimov. What next?

What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings forgetting Dmitri and
everything he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and as we know got
a rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street and
went off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:
I know nothing of it never heard of it till the day before yesterday.
And why didnt you come to the police till now? I was frightened.
And why did you try to hang yourself? From anxiety. What anxiety?
That I should be accused of it. Well thats the whole story. And now
what do you suppose they deduced from that?

Why theres no supposing. Theres a clue such as it is a fact. You
wouldnt have your painter set free?

Now theyve simply taken him for the murderer. They havent a shadow of
doubt.

Thats nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You
must admit that if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old
womans box have come into Nikolays hands they must have come there
somehow. Thats a good deal in such a case.

How did they get there? How did they get there? cried Razumihin.
How can you a doctor whose duty it is to study man and who has more
opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail
to see the character of the man in the whole story? Dont you see at
once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy
truth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped
on the box and picked it up.

The holy truth! But didnt he own himself that he told a lie at first?

Listen to me listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakov
and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who
was sitting in the porters lodge and the man Kryukov who had just got
out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his
arm that is eight or ten witnesses agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on
the ground was lying on him beating him while Dmitri hung on to his
hair beating him too. They lay right across the way blocking the
thoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they like children
(the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another
squealing fighting and laughing with the funniest faces and chasing
one another like children they ran into the street. Now take careful
note. The bodies upstairs were warm you understand warm when they
found them! If they or Nikolay alone had murdered them and broken open
the boxes or simply taken part in the robbery allow me to ask you one
question: do their state of mind their squeals and giggles and childish
scuffling at the gate fit in with axes bloodshed fiendish cunning
robbery? Theyd just killed them not five or ten minutes before for
the bodies were still warm and at once leaving the flat open knowing
that people would go there at once flinging away their booty they
rolled about like children laughing and attracting general attention.
And there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!

Of course it is strange! Its impossible indeed but...

No brother no _buts_. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolays
hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important
piece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation
given by him accounts for it and therefore it does not tell seriously
against him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him
innocent especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. And
do you suppose from the character of our legal system that they will
accept or that they are in a position to accept this fact--resting
simply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively
breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No they
wont accept it they certainly wont because they found the jewel-case
and the man tried to hang himself which he could not have done if he
hadnt felt guilty. Thats the point thats what excites me you must
understand!

Oh I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof
is there that the box came from the old woman?

Thats been proved said Razumihin with apparent reluctance frowning.
Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner who
proved conclusively that it was his.

Thats bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time
that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first and is there no
evidence about that?

Nobody did see him Razumihin answered with vexation. Thats the
worst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way
upstairs though indeed their evidence could not have been worth much.
They said they saw the flat was open and that there must be work going
on in it but they took no special notice and could not remember whether
there actually were men at work in it.

Hm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating
one another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption but...
How do you explain the facts yourself?

How do I explain them? What is there to explain? Its clear. At any
rate the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear and
the jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.
The murderer was upstairs locked in when Koch and Pestryakov knocked
at the door. Koch like an ass did not stay at the door; so the
murderer popped out and ran down too; for he had no other way of
escape. He hid from Koch Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when
Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the
porter and others were going upstairs waited till they were out of
hearing and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri
and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;
possibly he was seen but not noticed. There are lots of people going
in and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when
he stood behind the door and did not notice he dropped them because he
had other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that
he did stand there.... Thats how I explain it.

Too clever! No my boy youre too clever. That beats everything.

But why why?

Why because everything fits too well... its too melodramatic.

A-ach! Razumihin was exclaiming but at that moment the door opened
and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.



CHAPTER V

This was a gentleman no longer young of a stiff and portly appearance
and a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the
doorway staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment
as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.
Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost
affronted he scanned Raskolnikovs low and narrow cabin. With the
same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov who lay undressed dishevelled
unwashed on his miserable dirty sofa looking fixedly at him. Then with
the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth unkempt figure and
unshaven face of Razumihin who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the
face without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a
couple of minutes and then as might be expected some scene-shifting
took place. Reflecting probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs
that he would get nothing in this cabin by attempting to overawe them
the gentleman softened somewhat and civilly though with some severity
emphasising every syllable of his question addressed Zossimov:

Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov a student or formerly a student?

Zossimov made a slight movement and would have answered had not
Razumihin anticipated him.

Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?

This familiar what do you want seemed to cut the ground from the
feet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin but checked
himself in time and turned to Zossimov again.

This is Raskolnikov mumbled Zossimov nodding towards him. Then he
gave a prolonged yawn opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he
lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket pulled out a huge gold
watch in a round hunters case opened it looked at it and as slowly
and lazily proceeded to put it back.

Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking on his back gazing
persistently though without understanding at the stranger. Now that
his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper it
was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish as though he had just
undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But
the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention then his wonder
then suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said This is Raskolnikov
 he jumped up quickly sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant but
weak and breaking voice articulated:

Yes I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?

The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:

Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name
is not wholly unknown to you?

But Raskolnikov who had expected something quite different gazed
blankly and dreamily at him making no reply as though he heard the
name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.

Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no
information? asked Pyotr Petrovitch somewhat disconcerted.

In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow put his hands
behind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into
Luzhins face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively
than ever and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.

I had presumed and calculated he faltered that a letter posted more
than ten days if not a fortnight ago...

I say why are you standing in the doorway? Razumihin interrupted
suddenly. If youve something to say sit down. Nastasya and you are so
crowded. Nastasya make room. Heres a chair thread your way in!

He moved his chair back from the table made a little space between the
table and his knees and waited in a rather cramped position for the
visitor to thread his way in. The minute was so chosen that it was
impossible to refuse and the visitor squeezed his way through hurrying
and stumbling. Reaching the chair he sat down looking suspiciously at
Razumihin.

No need to be nervous the latter blurted out. Rodya has been ill for
the last five days and delirious for three but now he is recovering and
has got an appetite. This is his doctor who has just had a look at him.
I am a comrade of Rodyas like him formerly a student and now I am
nursing him; so dont you take any notice of us but go on with your
business.

Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and
conversation? Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov.

N-no mumbled Zossimov; you may amuse him. He yawned again.

He has been conscious a long time since the morning went on
Razumihin whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature
that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful partly perhaps
because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a
student.

Your mamma began Luzhin.

Hm! Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at him
inquiringly.

Thats all right go on.

Luzhin shrugged his shoulders.

Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in
her neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to
elapse before coming to see you in order that I might be fully
assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now to my
astonishment...

I know I know! Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.
So you are the _fianc_? I know and thats enough!

There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitchs being offended this time
but he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all
meant. There was a moments silence.

Meanwhile Raskolnikov who had turned a little towards him when he
answered began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity as
though he had not had a good look at him yet or as though something
new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at
him. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitchs whole
appearance something which seemed to justify the title of fianc so
unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place it was evident far
too much so indeed that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few
days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation
of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding
indeed. Even his own perhaps too complacent consciousness of the
agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such
circumstances seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rle of
fianc. All his clothes were fresh from the tailors and were all
right except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even
the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch
treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The
exquisite pair of lavender gloves real Louvain told the same tale
if only from the fact of his not wearing them but carrying them in
his hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr
Petrovitchs attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade
light thin trousers a waistcoat of the same new and fine linen a
cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it and the best
of it was this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even
handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.
His dark mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides
growing thickly upon his shining clean-shaven chin. Even his hair
touched here and there with grey though it had been combed and curled
at a hairdressers did not give him a stupid appearance as curled hair
usually does by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.
If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather
good-looking and imposing countenance it was due to quite other
causes. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously Raskolnikov smiled
malignantly sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as
before.

But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no
notice of their oddities.

I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation he began
again breaking the silence with an effort. If I had been aware of your
illness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I
have too a very important legal affair in the Senate not to mention
other preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your
mamma and sister any minute.

Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed
some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused waited but as nothing
followed he went on:

... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival.

Where? asked Raskolnikov weakly.

Very near here in Bakaleyevs house.

Thats in Voskresensky put in Razumihin. There are two storeys of
rooms let by a merchant called Yushin; Ive been there.

Yes rooms...

A disgusting place--filthy stinking and whats more of doubtful
character. Things have happened there and there are all sorts of queer
people living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. Its
cheap though...

I could not of course find out so much about it for I am a stranger
in Petersburg myself Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. However the
two rooms are exceedingly clean and as it is for so short a time...
I have already taken a permanent that is our future flat he said
addressing Raskolnikov and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am
myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch
Lebeziatnikov in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me
of Bakaleyevs house too...

Lebeziatnikov? said Raskolnikov slowly as if recalling something.

Yes Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov a clerk in the Ministry. Do you
know him?

Yes... no Raskolnikov answered.

Excuse me I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....
A very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one
learns new things from them. Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.

How do you mean? asked Razumihin.

In the most serious and essential matters Pyotr Petrovitch replied
as though delighted at the question. You see its ten years since I
visited Petersburg. All the novelties reforms ideas have reached us in
the provinces but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.
And its my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the
younger generation. And I confess I am delighted...

At what?

Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken but I fancy I find
clearer views more so to say criticism more practicality...

Thats true Zossimov let drop.

Nonsense! Theres no practicality. Razumihin flew at him.
Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from
heaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from
all practical life. Ideas if you like are fermenting he said to
Pyotr Petrovitch and desire for good exists though its in a childish
form and honesty you may find although there are crowds of brigands.
Anyway theres no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.

I dont agree with you Pyotr Petrovitch replied with evident
enjoyment. Of course people do get carried away and make mistakes
but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of
enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little
has been done the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.
Its my personal view if you care to know that something has been
accomplished already. New valuable ideas new valuable works are
circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.
Literature is taking a maturer form many injurious prejudices have been
rooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word we have cut ourselves
off irrevocably from the past and that to my thinking is a great
thing...

Hes learnt it by heart to show off! Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.

What? asked Pyotr Petrovitch not catching his words; but he received
no reply.

Thats all true Zossimov hastened to interpose.

Isnt it so? Pyotr Petrovitch went on glancing affably at Zossimov.
You must admit he went on addressing Razumihin with a shade of
triumph and superciliousness--he almost added young man--that there
is an advance or as they say now progress in the name of science and
economic truth...

A commonplace.

No not a commonplace! Hitherto for instance if I were told love
thy neighbour what came of it? Pyotr Petrovitch went on perhaps with
excessive haste. It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my
neighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has
it Catch several hares and you wont catch one. Science now tells
us love yourself before all men for everything in the world rests on
self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly
and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private
affairs are organised in society--the more whole coats so to say--the
firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare
organised too. Therefore in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for
myself I am acquiring so to speak for all and helping to bring to
pass my neighbours getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not
from private personal liberality but as a consequence of the general
advance. The idea is simple but unhappily it has been a long time
reaching us being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it
would seem to want very little wit to perceive it...

Excuse me Ive very little wit myself Razumihin cut in sharply
and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object but Ive
grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse
oneself of this incessant flow of commonplaces always the same that
by Jove I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a
hurry no doubt to exhibit your acquirements; and I dont blame you
thats quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you
are for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive
cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything
they touched that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. Thats
enough!

Excuse me sir said Luzhin affronted and speaking with excessive
dignity. Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too...

Oh my dear sir... how could I?... Come thats enough Razumihin
concluded and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous
conversation.

Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He made up
his mind to take leave in another minute or two.

I trust our acquaintance he said addressing Raskolnikov may upon
your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware
become closer... Above all I hope for your return to health...

Raskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petrovitch began getting
up from his chair.

One of her customers must have killed her Zossimov declared
positively.

Not a doubt of it replied Razumihin. Porfiry doesnt give his
opinion but is examining all who have left pledges with her there.

Examining them? Raskolnikov asked aloud.

Yes. What then?

Nothing.

How does he get hold of them? asked Zossimov.

Koch has given the names of some of them other names are on the
wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves.

It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The boldness of it!
The coolness!

Thats just what it wasnt! interposed Razumihin. Thats what throws
you all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning not
practised and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that
it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesnt work. Suppose
him to have been inexperienced and its clear that it was only a chance
that saved him--and chance may do anything. Why he did not foresee
obstacles perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worth
ten or twenty roubles stuffing his pockets with them ransacked the
old womans trunks her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles
besides notes in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know
how to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime I assure you
his first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by luck than good
counsel!

You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker I believe? Pyotr
Petrovitch put in addressing Zossimov. He was standing hat and gloves
in hand but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more
intellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourable
impression and his vanity overcame his prudence.

Yes. Youve heard of it?

Oh yes being in the neighbourhood.

Do you know the details?

I cant say that; but another circumstance interests me in the
case--the whole question so to say. Not to speak of the fact that crime
has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last
five years not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere
what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes
too crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears of a
students robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of
good social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole
gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets and one of
the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary
abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... And if this old
woman the pawnbroker has been murdered by someone of a higher class
in society--for peasants dont pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain
this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?

There are many economic changes put in Zossimov.

How are we to explain it? Razumihin caught him up. It might be
explained by our inveterate impracticality.

How do you mean?

What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he
was forging notes? Everybody is getting rich one way or another so I
want to make haste to get rich too. I dont remember the exact words
but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing without waiting or
working! Weve grown used to having everything ready-made to walking
on crutches to having our food chewed for us. Then the great hour
struck[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours.

     [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant.
     --TRANSLATORS NOTE.

But morality? And so to speak principles...

But why do you worry about it? Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. Its
in accordance with your theory!

In accordance with my theory?

Why carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now and
it follows that people may be killed...

Upon my word! cried Luzhin.

No thats not so put in Zossimov.

Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip breathing
painfully.

Theres a measure in all things Luzhin went on superciliously.
Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder and one has but to
suppose...

And is it true Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly again in a
voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him is it true that
you told your _fiance_... within an hour of her acceptance that what
pleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better
to raise a wife from poverty so that you may have complete control over
her and reproach her with your being her benefactor?

Upon my word Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably crimson with
confusion to distort my words in this way! Excuse me allow me to
assure you that the report which has reached you or rather let me say
has been conveyed to you has no foundation in truth and I... suspect
who... in a word... this arrow... in a word your mamma... She seemed
to me in other things with all her excellent qualities of a somewhat
high-flown and romantic way of thinking.... But I was a thousand miles
from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in
so fanciful a way.... And indeed... indeed...

I tell you what cried Raskolnikov raising himself on his pillow and
fixing his piercing glittering eyes upon him I tell you what.

What? Luzhin stood still waiting with a defiant and offended face.
Silence lasted for some seconds.

Why if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about my
mother... I shall send you flying downstairs!

Whats the matter with you? cried Razumihin.

So thats how it is? Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. Let me tell
you sir he began deliberately doing his utmost to restrain himself
but breathing hard at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed
to me but I remained here on purpose to find out more. I could forgive
a great deal in a sick man and a connection but you... never after
this...

I am not ill cried Raskolnikov.

So much the worse...

Go to hell!

But Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech squeezing
between the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him
pass. Without glancing at anyone and not even nodding to Zossimov who
had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone
he went out lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid
crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve of
his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.

How could you--how could you! Razumihin said shaking his head in
perplexity.

Let me alone--let me alone all of you! Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.
Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I am
not afraid of anyone anyone now! Get away from me! I want to be alone
alone alone!

Come along said Zossimov nodding to Razumihin.

But we cant leave him like this!

Come along Zossimov repeated insistently and he went out. Razumihin
thought a minute and ran to overtake him.

It might be worse not to obey him said Zossimov on the stairs. He
mustnt be irritated.

Whats the matter with him?

If only he could get some favourable shock thats what would do it! At
first he was better.... You know he has got something on his mind! Some
fixed idea weighing on him.... I am very much afraid so; he must have!

Perhaps its that gentleman Pyotr Petrovitch. From his conversation
I gather he is going to marry his sister and that he had received a
letter about it just before his illness....

Yes confound the man! he may have upset the case altogether. But have
you noticed he takes no interest in anything he does not respond to
anything except one point on which he seems excited--thats the murder?

Yes yes Razumihin agreed I noticed that too. He is interested
frightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police
office; he fainted.

Tell me more about that this evening and Ill tell you something
afterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour Ill go and see
him again.... Therell be no inflammation though.

Thanks! And Ill wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him
through Nastasya....

Raskolnikov left alone looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya
but she still lingered.

Wont you have some tea now? she asked.

Later! I am sleepy! Leave me.

He turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.



CHAPTER VI

But as soon as she went out he got up latched the door undid the
parcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again
and began dressing. Strange to say he seemed immediately to have become
perfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic
fear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange
sudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was
evident in them. To-day to-day he muttered to himself. He understood
that he was still weak but his intense spiritual concentration gave him
strength and self-confidence. He hoped moreover that he would not
fall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes he
looked at the money lying on the table and after a moments thought
put it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all the
copper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.
Then he softly unlatched the door went out slipped downstairs and
glanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her back
to him blowing up the landladys samovar. She heard nothing. Who would
have dreamed of his going out indeed? A minute later he was in the
street.

It was nearly eight oclock the sun was setting. It was as stifling as
before but he eagerly drank in the stinking dusty town air. His head
felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his
feverish eyes and his wasted pale and yellow face. He did not know and
did not think where he was going he had one thought only: that all
_this_ must be ended to-day once for all immediately; that he would
not return home without it because he _would not go on living like
that_. How with what to make an end? He had not an idea about it
he did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thought
tortured him. All he knew all he felt was that everything must be
changed one way or another he repeated with desperate and immovable
self-confidence and determination.

From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay
Market. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in
the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very
sentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen who stood
on the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline a
mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it all very
old and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice cracked and
coarsened by street singing she sang in hope of getting a copper from
the shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners took out a five
copeck piece and put it in the girls hand. She broke off abruptly on a
sentimental high note shouted sharply to the organ grinder Come on
 and both moved on to the next shop.

Do you like street music? said Raskolnikov addressing a middle-aged
man standing idly by him. The man looked at him startled and wondering.

I love to hear singing to a street organ said Raskolnikov and his
manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--I like it
on cold dark damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the
passers-by have pale green sickly faces or better still when wet
snow is falling straight down when theres no wind--you know what I
mean?--and the street lamps shine through it...

I dont know.... Excuse me... muttered the stranger frightened by the
question and Raskolnikovs strange manner and he crossed over to the
other side of the street.

Raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay
Market where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but
they were not there now. Recognising the place he stopped looked round
and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a
corn chandlers shop.

Isnt there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?

All sorts of people keep booths here answered the young man glancing
superciliously at Raskolnikov.

Whats his name?

What he was christened.

Arent you a Zarasky man too? Which province?

The young man looked at Raskolnikov again.

Its not a province your excellency but a district. Graciously
forgive me your excellency!

Is that a tavern at the top there?

Yes its an eating-house and theres a billiard-room and youll find
princesses there too.... La-la!

Raskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd
of peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it looking
at the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into
conversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; they
were all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little and
took a turning to the right in the direction of V.

He had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle leading
from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawn
to wander about this district when he felt depressed that he might
feel more so.

Now he walked along thinking of nothing. At that point there is a great
block of buildings entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;
women were continually running in and out bare-headed and in their
indoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups on the pavement
especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in
the lower storeys. From one of these a loud din sounds of singing the
tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment floated into the street.
A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the
steps others on the pavement others were standing talking. A drunken
soldier smoking a cigarette was walking near them in the road
swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere but had
forgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another and a man dead
drunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of
women who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore
cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some
not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.

He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and
uproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing
frantically marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar
and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently
gloomily and dreamily bending down at the entrance and peeping
inquisitively in from the pavement.

  Oh my handsome soldier
   Dont beat me for nothing

trilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire to
make out what he was singing as though everything depended on that.

Shall I go in? he thought. They are laughing. From drink. Shall I get
drunk?

Wont you come in? one of the women asked him. Her voice was
still musical and less thick than the others she was young and not
repulsive--the only one of the group.

Why shes pretty he said drawing himself up and looking at her.

She smiled much pleased at the compliment.

Youre very nice looking yourself she said.

Isnt he thin though! observed another woman in a deep bass. Have you
just come out of a hospital?

Theyre all generals daughters it seems but they have all snub
noses interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face wearing
a loose coat. See how jolly they are.

Go along with you!

Ill go sweetie!

And he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov moved on.

I say sir the girl shouted after him.

What is it?

She hesitated.

Ill always be pleased to spend an hour with you kind gentleman but
now I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a drink theres a nice young
man!

Raskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.

Ah what a good-natured gentleman!

Whats your name?

Ask for Duclida.

Well thats too much one of the women observed shaking her head
at Duclida. I dont know how you can ask like that. I believe I should
drop with shame....

Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wench
of thirty covered with bruises with her upper lip swollen. She made
her criticism quietly and earnestly. Where is it thought Raskolnikov.
Where is it Ive read that someone condemned to death says or thinks
an hour before his death that if he had to live on some high rock
on such a narrow ledge that hed only room to stand and the ocean
everlasting darkness everlasting solitude everlasting tempest around
him if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his
life a thousand years eternity it were better to live so than to die
at once! Only to live to live and live! Life whatever it may be!...
How true it is! Good God how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile
is he who calls him vile for that he added a moment later.

He went into another street. Bah the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin
was just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it
I wanted? Yes the newspapers.... Zossimov said hed read it in the
papers. Have you the papers? he asked going into a very spacious and
positively clean restaurant consisting of several rooms which were
however rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea and in a
room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov
fancied that Zametov was one of them but he could not be sure at that
distance. What if it is? he thought.

Will you have vodka? asked the waiter.

Give me some tea and bring me the papers the old ones for the last
five days and Ill give you something.

Yes sir heres to-days. No vodka?

The old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and
began to look through them.

Oh damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on a
staircase spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol a fire
in Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the
Petersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....
Ah here it is! He found at last what he was seeking and began to
read it. The lines danced before his eyes but he read it all and began
eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His hands
shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someone
sat down beside him at his table. He looked up it was the head clerk
Zametov looking just the same with the rings on his fingers and the
watch-chain with the curly black hair parted and pomaded with the
smart waistcoat rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good
humour at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark
face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.

What you here? he began in surprise speaking as though hed known
him all his life. Why Razumihin told me only yesterday you were
unconscious. How strange! And do you know Ive been to see you?

Raskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers and
turned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips and a new shade of
irritable impatience was apparent in that smile.

I know you have he answered. Ive heard it. You looked for my
sock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you? He says
youve been with him to Luise Ivanovnas--you know the woman you tried
to befriend for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he
would not understand. Do you remember? How could he fail to
understand--it was quite clear wasnt it?

What a hot head he is!

The explosive one?

No your friend Razumihin.

You must have a jolly life Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most
agreeable places. Whos been pouring champagne into you just now?

Weve just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring
it into me!

By way of a fee! You profit by everything! Raskolnikov laughed its
all right my dear boy he added slapping Zametov on the shoulder. I
am not speaking from temper but in a friendly way for sport as that
workman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri in the case of
the old woman....

How do you know about it?

Perhaps I know more about it than you do.

How strange you are.... I am sure you are still very unwell. You
oughtnt to have come out.

Oh do I seem strange to you?

Yes. What are you doing reading the papers?

Yes.

Theres a lot about the fires.

No I am not reading about the fires. Here he looked mysteriously at
Zametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. No I am not
reading about the fires he went on winking at Zametov. But confess
now my dear fellow youre awfully anxious to know what I am reading
about?

I am not in the least. Maynt I ask a question? Why do you keep
on...?

Listen you are a man of culture and education?

I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium said Zametov with some
dignity.

Sixth class! Ah my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--you
are a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy! Here Raskolnikov
broke into a nervous laugh right in Zametovs face. The latter drew
back more amazed than offended.

Foo! how strange you are! Zametov repeated very seriously. I cant
help thinking you are still delirious.

I am delirious? You are fibbing my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You
find me curious do you?

Yes curious.

Shall I tell you what I was reading about what I was looking for? See
what a lot of papers Ive made them bring me. Suspicious eh?

Well what is it?

You prick up your ears?

How do you mean--prick up my ears?

Ill explain that afterwards but now my boy I declare to you... no
better I confess... No thats not right either; I make a deposition
and you take it. I depose that I was reading that I was looking and
searching.... he screwed up his eyes and paused. I was searching--and
came here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old
pawnbroker woman he articulated at last almost in a whisper bringing
his face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at him
steadily without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov
afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for
exactly a minute and that they gazed at one another all the while.

What if you have been reading about it? he cried at last perplexed
and impatient. Thats no business of mine! What of it?

The same old woman Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper not
heeding Zametovs explanation about whom you were talking in the
police-office you remember when I fainted. Well do you understand
now?

What do you mean? Understand... what? Zametov brought out almost
alarmed.

Raskolnikovs set and earnest face was suddenly transformed and he
suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before as though
utterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled with
extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past that
moment when he stood with the axe behind the door while the latch
trembled and the men outside swore and shook it and he had a sudden
desire to shout at them to swear at them to put out his tongue at
them to mock them to laugh and laugh and laugh!

You are either mad or... began Zametov and he broke off as though
stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.

Or? Or what? What? Come tell me!

Nothing said Zametov getting angry its all nonsense!

Both were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became
suddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table and
leaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgotten
Zametov. The silence lasted for some time.

Why dont you drink your tea? Its getting cold said Zametov.

What! Tea? Oh yes.... Raskolnikov sipped the glass put a morsel of
bread in his mouth and suddenly looking at Zametov seemed to remember
everything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face
resumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.

There have been a great many of these crimes lately said Zametov.
Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of
false coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. They
used to forge tickets!

Oh but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago
 Raskolnikov answered calmly. So you consider them criminals? he added
smiling.

Of course they are criminals.

They? They are children simpletons not criminals! Why half a hundred
people meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be too
many and then they want to have more faith in one another than in
themselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.
Simpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what
a thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well let us suppose that these
simpletons succeed and each makes a million and what follows for the
rest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his
life! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change
the notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand
roubles and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand
but did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the
money into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. And
the whole thing came to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?

That his hands trembled? observed Zametov yes thats quite
possible. That I feel quite sure is possible. Sometimes one cant
stand things.

Cant stand that?

Why could you stand it then? No I couldnt. For the sake of a hundred
roubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notes
into a bank where its their business to spot that sort of thing! No I
should not have the face to do it. Would you?

Raskolnikov had an intense desire again to put his tongue out. Shivers
kept running down his spine.

I should do it quite differently Raskolnikov began. This is how I
would change the notes: Id count the first thousand three or four times
backwards and forwards looking at every note and then Id set to the
second thousand; Id count that half-way through and then hold some
fifty-rouble note to the light then turn it then hold it to the light
again--to see whether it was a good one. I am afraid I would say a
relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a
false note and then Id tell them the whole story. And after I began
counting the third No excuse me I would say I fancy I made a
mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand I am not sure.
And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and
so on to the end. And when I had finished Id pick out one from the
fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light
and ask again Change them please and put the clerk into such a stew
that he would not know how to get rid of me. When Id finished and had
gone out Id come back No excuse me and ask for some explanation.
Thats how Id do it.

Foo! what terrible things you say! said Zametov laughing. But all
that is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds youd make a slip.
I believe that even a practised desperate man cannot always reckon on
himself much less you and I. To take an example near home--that old
woman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been a
desperate fellow he risked everything in open daylight was saved by
a miracle--but his hands shook too. He did not succeed in robbing the
place he couldnt stand it. That was clear from the...

Raskolnikov seemed offended.

Clear? Why dont you catch him then? he cried maliciously gibing at
Zametov.

Well they will catch him.

Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? Youve a tough job! A
great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he had
no money and suddenly begins spending he must be the man. So that any
child can mislead you.

The fact is they always do that though answered Zametov. A man will
commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes
drinking in a tavern. They are caught spending money they are not all
as cunning as you are. You wouldnt go to a tavern of course?

Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.

You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should
behave in that case too? he asked with displeasure.

I should like to Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat too
much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.

Very much?

Very much!

All right then. This is how I should behave Raskolnikov began again
bringing his face close to Zametovs again staring at him and speaking
in a whisper so that the latter positively shuddered. This is what
I should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels I should
have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place
with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen some kitchen garden
or place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone
weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from
the time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure
to be a hollow under it and I would put the jewels and money in that
hole. Then Id roll the stone back so that it would look as before
would press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two
three maybe I would not touch it. And well they could search! Thered
be no trace.

You are a madman said Zametov and for some reason he too spoke in a
whisper and moved away from Raskolnikov whose eyes were glittering. He
had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.
He bent down as close as possible to Zametov and his lips began to move
without uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he
was doing but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled on
his lips like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break
out in another moment he will let it go he will speak out.

And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta? he said
suddenly and--realised what he had done.

Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. His
face wore a contorted smile.

But is it possible? he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov looked
wrathfully at him.

Own up that you believed it yes you did?

Not a bit of it I believe it less than ever now Zametov cried
hastily.

Ive caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before if now you
believe less than ever?

Not at all cried Zametov obviously embarrassed. Have you been
frightening me so as to lead up to this?

You dont believe it then? What were you talking about behind my
back when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive
lieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey there he shouted to the
waiter getting up and taking his cap how much?

Thirty copecks the latter replied running up.

And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money! he
held out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. Red notes and
blue twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new
clothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. Youve cross-examined my
landlady Ill be bound.... Well thats enough! _Assez caus!_ Till we
meet again!

He went out trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical
sensation in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet he
was gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.
His fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock any irritating sensation
stimulated and revived his energies at once but his strength failed as
quickly when the stimulus was removed.

Zametov left alone sat for a long time in the same place plunged in
thought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on
a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.

Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead he decided.

Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he
stumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other
till they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stood
looking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded then
anger real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.

So here you are! he shouted at the top of his voice--you ran away
from your bed! And here Ive been looking for you under the sofa! We
went up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here
he is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole
truth! Confess! Do you hear?

It means that Im sick to death of you all and I want to be alone
 Raskolnikov answered calmly.

Alone? When you are not able to walk when your face is as white as a
sheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doing
in the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!

Let me go! said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This was too much
for Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.

Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what Ill do
with you directly? Ill pick you up tie you up in a bundle carry you
home under my arm and lock you up!

Listen Razumihin Raskolnikov began quietly apparently calm--cant
you see that I dont want your benevolence? A strange desire you have to
shower benefits on a man who... curses them who feels them a burden in
fact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe I
was very glad to die. Didnt I tell you plainly enough to-day that
you were torturing me that I was... sick of you! You seem to want to
torture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my
recovery because its continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov
went away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too for
goodness sake! What right have you indeed to keep me by force? Dont
you see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How how can
I persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may be
ungrateful I may be mean only let me be for Gods sake let me be!
Let me be let me be!

He began calmly gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was
about to utter but finished panting for breath in a frenzy as he had
been with Luzhin.

Razumihin stood a moment thought and let his hand drop.

Well go to hell then he said gently and thoughtfully. Stay he
roared as Raskolnikov was about to move. Listen to me. Let me tell
you that you are all a set of babbling posing idiots! If youve any
little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are
plagiarists even in that! There isnt a sign of independent life in
you! You are made of spermaceti ointment and youve lymph in your veins
instead of blood. I dont believe in anyone of you! In any circumstances
the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being! Stop! he
cried with redoubled fury noticing that Raskolnikov was again making
a movement--hear me out! You know Im having a house-warming this
evening I dare say theyve arrived by now but I left my uncle there--I
just ran in--to receive the guests. And if you werent a fool a common
fool a perfect fool if you were an original instead of a translation...
you see Rodya I recognise youre a clever fellow but youre a
fool!--and if you werent a fool youd come round to me this evening
instead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone
out theres no help for it! Id give you a snug easy chair my landlady
has one... a cup of tea company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any
way you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?

No.

R-rubbish! Razumihin shouted out of patience. How do you know?
You cant answer for yourself! You dont know anything about it....
Thousands of times Ive fought tooth and nail with people and run back
to them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! So
remember Potchinkovs house on the third storey....

Why Mr. Razumihin I do believe youd let anybody beat you from sheer
benevolence.

Beat? Whom? Me? Id twist his nose off at the mere idea! Potchinkovs
house 47 Babushkins flat....

I shall not come Razumihin. Raskolnikov turned and walked away.

I bet you will Razumihin shouted after him. I refuse to know you if
you dont! Stay hey is Zametov in there?

Yes.

Did you see him?

Yes.

Talked to him?

Yes.

What about? Confound you dont tell me then. Potchinkovs house 47
Babushkins flat remember!

Raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street.
Razumihin looked after him thoughtfully. Then with a wave of his hand he
went into the house but stopped short of the stairs.

Confound it he went on almost aloud. He talked sensibly but yet...
I am a fool! As if madmen didnt talk sensibly! And this was just what
Zossimov seemed afraid of. He struck his finger on his forehead. What
if... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach
what a blunder! I cant. And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov but
there was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to
the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.

Raskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge stood in the middle and
leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On parting
with Razumihin he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this
place. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending
over the water he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the
sunset at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight at
one distant attic window on the left bank flashing as though on fire in
the last rays of the setting sun at the darkening water of the canal
and the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashed
before his eyes the houses seemed moving the passers-by the canal
banks the carriages all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started
saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He
became aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked
and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head with a long yellow
wasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him but
obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned her
right hand on the parapet lifted her right leg over the railing then
her left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted and
swallowed up its victim for a moment but an instant later the drowning
woman floated to the surface moving slowly with the current her head
and legs in the water her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.

A woman drowning! A woman drowning! shouted dozens of voices; people
ran up both banks were thronged with spectators on the bridge people
crowded about Raskolnikov pressing up behind him.

Mercy on it! its our Afrosinya! a woman cried tearfully close by.
Mercy! save her! kind people pull her out!

A boat a boat was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of a
boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal threw off his great
coat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:
she floated within a couple of yards from the steps he caught hold of
her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a
comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They
laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered
consciousness raised her head sat up and began sneezing and coughing
stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.

Shes drunk herself out of her senses the same womans voice wailed
at her side. Out of her senses. The other day she tried to hang
herself we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now left my little
girl to look after her--and here shes in trouble again! A neighbour
gentleman a neighbour we live close by the second house from the end
see yonder....

The crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman someone
mentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange
sensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. No thats
loathsome... water... its not good enough he muttered to himself.
Nothing will come of it he added no use to wait. What about the
police office...? And why isnt Zametov at the police office? The police
office is open till ten oclock.... He turned his back to the railing
and looked about him.

Very well then! he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and
walked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow and
empty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed there
was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out to make an
end of it all. Complete apathy had succeeded to it.

Well its a way out of it he thought walking slowly and listlessly
along the canal bank. Anyway Ill make an end for I want to.... But
is it a way out? What does it matter! Therell be the square yard of
space--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or
not? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie
down soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I dont
care about that either! What idiotic ideas come into ones head.

To reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the
second turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at the
first turning he stopped and after a minutes thought turned into a
side street and went two streets out of his way possibly without any
object or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked looking
at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted
his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.
He had not passed it he had not been near it since _that_ evening.
An overwhelming unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the
house passed through the gateway then into the first entrance on the
right and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.
The narrow steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing
and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework
of the window had been taken out. That wasnt so then he thought.
Here was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been
working. Its shut up and the door newly painted. So its to let. Then
the third storey and the fourth. Here! He was perplexed to find the
door of the flat wide open. There were men there he could hear voices;
he had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last
stairs and went into the flat. It too was being done up; there were
workmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he
would find everything as he left it even perhaps the corpses in the
same places on the floor. And now bare walls no furniture; it seemed
strange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There
were two workmen both young fellows but one much younger than the
other. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with
lilac flowers instead of the old dirty yellow one. Raskolnikov for
some reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper
with dislike as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.
The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were
hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took
no notice of Raskolnikovs coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov
folded his arms and listened.

She comes to me in the morning said the elder to the younger very
early all dressed up. Why are you preening and prinking? says I. I
am ready to do anything to please you Tit Vassilitch! Thats a way of
going on! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!

And what is a fashion book? the younger one asked. He obviously
regarded the other as an authority.

A fashion book is a lot of pictures coloured and they come to the
tailors here every Saturday by post from abroad to show folks how
to dress the male sex as well as the female. Theyre pictures. The
gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies fluffles
theyre beyond anything you can fancy.

Theres nothing you cant find in Petersburg the younger cried
enthusiastically except father and mother theres everything!

Except them theres everything to be found my boy the elder
declared sententiously.

Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box
the bed and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very
tiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the
corner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it and
went to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.

What do you want? he asked suddenly.

Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the
bell. The same bell the same cracked note. He rang it a second and
a third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly
fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more
vividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more
satisfaction.

Well what do you want? Who are you? the workman shouted going out to
him. Raskolnikov went inside again.

I want to take a flat he said. I am looking round.

Its not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come up
with the porter.

The floors have been washed will they be painted? Raskolnikov went
on. Is there no blood?

What blood?

Why the old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was a
perfect pool there.

But who are you? the workman cried uneasy.

Who am I?

Yes.

You want to know? Come to the police station Ill tell you.

The workmen looked at him in amazement.

Its time for us to go we are late. Come along Alyoshka. We must lock
up said the elder workman.

Very well come along said Raskolnikov indifferently and going
out first he went slowly downstairs. Hey porter he cried in the
gateway.

At the entrance several people were standing staring at the passers-by;
the two porters a peasant woman a man in a long coat and a few others.
Raskolnikov went straight up to them.

What do you want? asked one of the porters.

Have you been to the police office?

Ive just been there. What do you want?

Is it open?

Of course.

Is the assistant there?

He was there for a time. What do you want?

Raskolnikov made no reply but stood beside them lost in thought.

Hes been to look at the flat said the elder workman coming forward.

Which flat?

Where we are at work. Why have you washed away the blood? says he.
There has been a murder here says he and Ive come to take it.
And he began ringing at the bell all but broke it. Come to the police
station says he. Ill tell you everything there. He wouldnt leave
us.

The porter looked at Raskolnikov frowning and perplexed.

Who are you? he shouted as impressively as he could.

I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov formerly a student I live in
Shils house not far from here flat Number 14 ask the porter he
knows me. Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy dreamy voice not
turning round but looking intently into the darkening street.

Why have you been to the flat?

To look at it.

What is there to look at?

Take him straight to the police station the man in the long coat
jerked in abruptly.

Raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the
same slow lazy tones:

Come along.

Yes take him the man went on more confidently. Why was he going
into _that_ whats in his mind eh?

Hes not drunk but God knows whats the matter with him muttered the
workman.

But what do you want? the porter shouted again beginning to get angry
in earnest--Why are you hanging about?

You funk the police station then? said Raskolnikov jeeringly.

How funk it? Why are you hanging about?

Hes a rogue! shouted the peasant woman.

Why waste time talking to him? cried the other porter a huge peasant
in a full open coat and with keys on his belt. Get along! He is a rogue
and no mistake. Get along!

And seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street. He
lurched forward but recovered his footing looked at the spectators in
silence and walked away.

Strange man! observed the workman.

There are strange folks about nowadays said the woman.

You should have taken him to the police station all the same said the
man in the long coat.

Better have nothing to do with him decided the big porter. A regular
rogue! Just what he wants you may be sure but once take him up you
wont get rid of him.... We know the sort!

Shall I go there or not? thought Raskolnikov standing in the middle
of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads and he looked about him as
though expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came all
was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked dead to him to
him alone.... All at once at the end of the street two hundred yards
away in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.
In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the
middle of the street. What is it? Raskolnikov turned to the right
and went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled
coldly when he recognised it for he had fully made up his mind to go to
the police station and knew that it would all soon be over.



CHAPTER VII

An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of
spirited grey horses; there was no one in it and the coachman had got
off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....
A mass of people had gathered round the police standing in front. One
of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying
close to the wheels. Everyone was talking shouting exclaiming; the
coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:

What a misfortune! Good Lord what a misfortune!

Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could and succeeded at last
in seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a
man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious and covered with
blood; he was very badly dressed but not like a workman. Blood was
flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed mutilated and
disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.

Merciful heaven! wailed the coachman what more could I do? If Id
been driving fast or had not shouted to him but I was going quietly
not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody
else. A drunken man cant walk straight we all know.... I saw him
crossing the street staggering and almost falling. I shouted again
and a second and a third time then I held the horses in but he fell
straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very
tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started
he screamed... that made them worse. Thats how it happened!

Thats just how it was a voice in the crowd confirmed.

He shouted thats true he shouted three times another voice
declared.

Three times it was we all heard it shouted a third.

But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was
evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who
was awaiting it somewhere; the police of course were in no little
anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to
take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew
his name.

Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The
lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate mans face. He recognised
him.

I know him! I know him! he shouted pushing to the front. Its a
government clerk retired from the service Marmeladov. He lives close
by in Kozels house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay see? He
pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in
violent agitation.

The police were glad that they had found out who the man was.
Raskolnikov gave his own name and address and as earnestly as if it
had been his father he besought the police to carry the unconscious
Marmeladov to his lodging at once.

Just here three houses away he said eagerly the house belongs to
Kozel a rich German. He was going home no doubt drunk. I know him
he is a drunkard. He has a family there a wife children he has one
daughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital and there is
sure to be a doctor in the house. Ill pay Ill pay! At least he will
be looked after at home... they will help him at once. But hell die
before you get him to the hospital. He managed to slip something
unseen into the policemans hand. But the thing was straightforward
and legitimate and in any case help was closer here. They raised the
injured man; people volunteered to help.

Kozels house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind
carefully holding Marmeladovs head and showing the way.

This way this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn
round! Ill pay Ill make it worth your while he muttered.

Katerina Ivanovna had just begun as she always did at every free
moment walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and
back again with her arms folded across her chest talking to herself
and coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest
girl Polenka a child of ten who though there was much she did not
understand understood very well that her mother needed her and so
always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost
to appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little
brother who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was
waiting for her to take off his shirt which had to be washed at night.
He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair with a silent
serious face with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels
together and toes turned out.

He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister sitting
perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes just as all good
little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little
girl still younger dressed literally in rags stood at the screen
waiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve
them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the
other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor
consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner
during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than
ever.

You wouldnt believe you cant imagine Polenka she said walking
about the room what a happy luxurious life we had in my papas house
and how this drunkard has brought me and will bring you all to ruin!
Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that
everyone who came to see him said We look upon you Ivan Mihailovitch
as our governor! When I... when... she coughed violently oh cursed
life she cried clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her
breast when I... when at the last ball... at the marshals...
Princess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your father
and I were married Polenka--she asked at once Isnt that the pretty
girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up? (You must mend
that tear you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you or
to-morrow--cough cough cough--he will make the hole bigger she
articulated with effort.) Prince Schegolskoy a kammerjunker had just
come from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to
make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions
and told him that my heart had long been anothers. That other was your
father Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me
the shirt and the stockings! Lida said she to the youngest one you
must manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out
with it... Ill wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond
doesnt come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout
he has torn it to rags! Id do it all together so as not to have to
work two nights running! Oh dear! (Cough cough cough cough!) Again!
Whats this? she cried noticing a crowd in the passage and the men
who were pushing into her room carrying a burden. What is it? What are
they bringing? Mercy on us!

Where are we to put him? asked the policeman looking round when
Marmeladov unconscious and covered with blood had been carried in.

On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa with his head this way
 Raskolnikov showed him.

Run over in the road! Drunk! someone shouted in the passage.

Katerina Ivanovna stood turning white and gasping for breath. The
children were terrified. Little Lida screamed rushed to Polenka and
clutched at her trembling all over.

Having laid Marmeladov down Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.

For Gods sake be calm dont be frightened! he said speaking
quickly he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage dont
be frightened he will come to I told them bring him here... Ive been
here already you remember? He will come to; Ill pay!

Hes done it this time! Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she
rushed to her husband.

Raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who
swoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless mans head a
pillow which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining
him. She kept her head forgetting herself biting her trembling lips
and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.

Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a
doctor it appeared next door but one.

Ive sent for a doctor he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna dont be
uneasy Ill pay. Havent you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel
anything as quick as you can.... He is injured but not killed believe
me.... We shall see what the doctor says!

Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window; there on a broken chair in the
corner a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood in
readiness for washing her childrens and husbands linen that night.
This washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a
week if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that they
were practically without change of linen and Katerina Ivanovna could
not endure uncleanliness and rather than see dirt in the house she
preferred to wear herself out at night working beyond her strength when
the rest were asleep so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry
by the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikovs request
but almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already
succeeded in finding a towel wetted it and began washing the blood off
Marmeladovs face.

Katerina Ivanovna stood by breathing painfully and pressing her hands
to her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began
to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man
brought here. The policeman too stood in hesitation.

Polenka cried Katerina Ivanovna run to Sonia make haste. If you
dont find her at home leave word that her father has been run over
and that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run Polenka!
there put on the shawl.

Run your fastest! cried the little boy on the chair suddenly after
which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity with round eyes his
heels thrust forward and his toes spread out.

Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldnt have
dropped a pin. The policemen left all except one who remained for a
time trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almost
all Madame Lippevechsels lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms
of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway but
afterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a
fury.

You might let him die in peace at least she shouted at the crowd
is it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough cough
cough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his
hat!... Get away! You should respect the dead at least!

Her cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. They
evidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers one after
another squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling
of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden
accident even in those nearest and dearest to the victim from which
no living man is exempt even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and
compassion.

Voices outside were heard however speaking of the hospital and saying
that theyd no business to make a disturbance here.

No business to die! cried Katerina Ivanovna and she was rushing to
the door to vent her wrath upon them but in the doorway came face to
face with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident
and ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and
irresponsible German.

Ah my God! she cried clasping her hands your husband drunken
horses have trampled! To the hospital with him! I am the landlady!

Amalia Ludwigovna I beg you to recollect what you are saying
 Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with
the landlady that she might remember her place and even now could not
deny herself this satisfaction). Amalia Ludwigovna...

I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may
not dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.

You are not Amalia Ivanovna but Amalia Ludwigovna and as I am not
one of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov whos laughing
behind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of they are at it
again was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you
Amalia Ludwigovna though I fail to understand why you dislike that
name. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;
he is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.
Let him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General
himself shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew
me as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been
a benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many
friends and protectors whom he abandoned himself from an honourable
pride knowing his unhappy weakness but now (she pointed to
Raskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance who has
wealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a
child. You may rest assured Amalia Ludwigovna...

All this was uttered with extreme rapidity getting quicker and quicker
but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovnas eloquence. At that
instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she
ran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or
understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew
deep slow painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth
and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising
Raskolnikov he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked
at him with a sad but stern face and tears trickled from her eyes.

My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding she said
in despair. We must take off his clothes. Turn a little Semyon
Zaharovitch if you can she cried to him.

Marmeladov recognised her.

A priest he articulated huskily.

Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window laid her head against the window
frame and exclaimed in despair:

Oh cursed life!

A priest the dying man said again after a moments silence.

Theyve gone for him Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him he obeyed her
shout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she
returned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for
long.

Soon his eyes rested on little Lida his favourite who was shaking in
the corner as though she were in a fit and staring at him with her
wondering childish eyes.

A-ah he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.

What now? cried Katerina Ivanovna.

Barefoot barefoot! he muttered indicating with frenzied eyes the
childs bare feet.

Be silent Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably you know why she is
barefooted.

Thank God the doctor exclaimed Raskolnikov relieved.

The doctor came in a precise little old man a German looking about
him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man took his pulse carefully
felt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the
blood-stained shirt and bared the injured mans chest. It was gashed
crushed and fractured several ribs on the right side were broken.
On the left side just over the heart was a large sinister-looking
yellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horses hoof. The doctor
frowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and
turned round with it for thirty yards on the road.

Its wonderful that he has recovered consciousness the doctor
whispered softly to Raskolnikov.

What do you think of him? he asked.

He will die immediately.

Is there really no hope?

Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured
too... Hm... I could bleed him if you like but... it would be useless.
He is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes.

Better bleed him then.

If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.

At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted
and the priest a little grey old man appeared in the doorway bearing
the sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.
The doctor changed places with him exchanging glances with him.
Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his
shoulders and remained.

All stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably
understood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.
Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida lifted the boy from the chair knelt
down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of
her. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy kneeling on his
little bare knees lifted his hand rhythmically crossing himself with
precision and bowed down touching the floor with his forehead which
seemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her
lips and held back her tears; she prayed too now and then pulling
straight the boys shirt and managed to cover the girls bare shoulders
with a kerchief which she took from the chest without rising from her
knees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was
opened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from
all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser but they did not
venture beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.

At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She
came in panting from running so fast took off her kerchief looked for
her mother went up to her and said Shes coming I met her in the
street. Her mother made her kneel beside her.

Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd
and strange was her appearance in that room in the midst of want rags
death and despair. She too was in rags her attire was all of
the cheapest but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp
unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the
doorway and looked about her bewildered unconscious of everything.
She forgot her fourth-hand gaudy silk dress so unseemly here with
its ridiculous long train and her immense crinoline that filled up the
whole doorway and her light-coloured shoes and the parasol she brought
with her though it was no use at night and the absurd round straw hat
with its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat
was a pale frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in
terror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair rather
pretty with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the
priest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers some
words in the crowd probably reached her. She looked down and took a
step forward into the room still keeping close to the door.

The service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.
The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and
consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.

What am I to do with these? she interrupted sharply and irritably
pointing to the little ones.

God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour the priest began.

Ach! He is merciful but not to us.

Thats a sin a sin madam observed the priest shaking his head.

And isnt that a sin? cried Katerina Ivanovna pointing to the dying
man.

Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to
compensate you at least for the loss of his earnings.

You dont understand! cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.
And why should they compensate me? Why he was drunk and threw himself
under the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.
He drank everything away the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink he
wasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God hes dying! One
less to keep!

You must forgive in the hour of death thats a sin madam such
feelings are a great sin.

Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water
wiping the blood and sweat from his head setting his pillow straight
and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now
she flew at him almost in a frenzy.

Ah father! Thats words and only words! Forgive! If hed not been run
over hed have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and
in rags and hed have fallen asleep like a log and I should have been
sousing and rinsing till daybreak washing his rags and the childrens
and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I
should have been darning them. Thats how I spend my nights!... Whats
the use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!

A terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief
to her lips and showed it to the priest pressing her other hand to her
aching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed
his head and said nothing.

Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face
of Katerina Ivanovna who was bending over him again. He kept trying
to say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and
articulating indistinctly but Katerina Ivanovna understanding that he
wanted to ask her forgiveness called peremptorily to him:

Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say! And the sick man
was silent but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the
doorway and he saw Sonia.

Till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a
corner.

Whos that? Whos that? he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice
in agitation turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his
daughter was standing and trying to sit up.

Lie down! Lie do-own! cried Katerina Ivanovna.

With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his
elbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter as
though not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.
Suddenly he recognised her crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and
gaudy finery meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying
father. His face showed intense suffering.

Sonia! Daughter! Forgive! he cried and he tried to hold out his hand
to her but losing his balance he fell off the sofa face downwards on
the floor. They rushed to pick him up they put him on the sofa; but he
was dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up embraced him and remained so
without moving. He died in her arms.

Hes got what he wanted Katerina Ivanovna cried seeing her husbands
dead body. Well whats to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can
I give them to-morrow to eat?

Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.

Katerina Ivanovna he began last week your husband told me all his
life and circumstances.... Believe me he spoke of you with passionate
reverence. From that evening when I learnt how devoted he was to you
all and how he loved and respected you especially Katerina Ivanovna
in spite of his unfortunate weakness from that evening we became
friends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my
dead friend. Here are twenty roubles I think--and if that can be of any
assistance to you then... I... in short I will come again I will
be sure to come again... I shall perhaps come again to-morrow....
Good-bye!

And he went quickly out of the room squeezing his way through the crowd
to the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim
Fomitch who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions
in person. They had not met since the scene at the police station but
Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.

Ah is that you? he asked him.

Hes dead answered Raskolnikov. The doctor and the priest have been
all as it should have been. Dont worry the poor woman too much she is
in consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up if possible... you are a
kind-hearted man I know... he added with a smile looking straight in
his face.

But you are spattered with blood observed Nikodim Fomitch noticing
in the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikovs waistcoat.

Yes... Im covered with blood Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;
then he smiled nodded and went downstairs.

He walked down slowly and deliberately feverish but not conscious
of it entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and
strength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be
compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been
pardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on
his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass exchanging a silent greeting
with him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid
footsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was
running after him calling Wait! wait!

He turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped
short a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov
could distinguish the childs thin but pretty little face looking at
him with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message
which she was evidently glad to give.

Tell me what is your name?... and where do you live? she said
hurriedly in a breathless voice.

He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of
rapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her he could not have said
why.

Who sent you?

Sister Sonia sent me answered the girl smiling still more brightly.

I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.

Mamma sent me too... when sister Sonia was sending me mamma came up
too and said Run fast Polenka.

Do you love sister Sonia?

I love her more than anyone Polenka answered with a peculiar
earnestness and her smile became graver.

And will you love me?

By way of answer he saw the little girls face approaching him her full
lips navely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks
held him tightly her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl
wept softly pressing her face against him.

I am sorry for father she said a moment later raising her
tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. Its
nothing but misfortunes now she added suddenly with that peculiarly
sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak
like grown-up people.

Did your father love you?

He loved Lida most she went on very seriously without a smile
exactly like grown-up people he loved her because she is little and
because she is ill too. And he always used to bring her presents. But
he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture too she added with
dignity. And mother never used to say anything but we knew that she
liked it and father knew it too. And mother wants to teach me French
for its time my education began.

And do you know your prayers?

Of course we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself
as I am a big girl now but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.
First they repeat the Ave Maria and then another prayer: Lord
forgive and bless sister Sonia and then another Lord forgive and
bless our second father. For our elder father is dead and this is
another one but we do pray for the other as well.

Polenka my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me too. And Thy
servant Rodion nothing more.

Ill pray for you all the rest of my life the little girl declared
hotly and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him
warmly once more.

Raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to
come next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was past
ten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing on
the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.

Enough he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. Ive done with
fancies imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! havent I lived
just now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of
Heaven to her--and now enough madam leave me in peace! Now for the
reign of reason and light... and of will and of strength... and now
we will see! We will try our strength! he added defiantly as though
challenging some power of darkness. And I was ready to consent to live
in a square of space!

I am very weak at this moment but... I believe my illness is all over.
I knew it would be over when I went out. By the way Potchinkovs house
is only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if
it were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him some
satisfaction too--no matter! Strength strength is what one wants you
can get nothing without it and strength must be won by strength--thats
what they dont know he added proudly and self-confidently and
he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and
self-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming
a different man every moment. What was it had happened to work this
revolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a
straw he suddenly felt that he too could live that there was still
life for him that his life had not died with the old woman. Perhaps he
was in too great a hurry with his conclusions but he did not think of
that.

But I did ask her to remember Thy servant Rodion in her prayers the
idea struck him. Well that was... in case of emergency he added and
laughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.

He easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at
Potchinkovs and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-way
upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big
gathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he could
hear exclamations and discussion. Razumihins room was fairly large; the
company consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry
where two of the landladys servants were busy behind a screen with two
samovars bottles plates and dishes of pie and savouries brought up
from the landladys kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran
out delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a
great deal to drink and though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite
drunk this time he was perceptibly affected by it.

Listen Raskolnikov hastened to say Ive only just come to tell you
youve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to
him. I cant come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And
so good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.

Do you know what? Ill see you home. If you say youre weak yourself
you must...

And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped
out?

He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncles I expect or perhaps
he has come without being invited... Ill leave uncle with them he
is an invaluable person pity I cant introduce you to him now. But
confound them all now! They wont notice me and I need a little fresh
air for youve come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I
should have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...
you simply cant imagine what men will say! Though why shouldnt you
imagine? Dont we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... thats the
way to learn not to!... Wait a minute Ill fetch Zossimov.

Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special
interest in him; soon his face brightened.

You must go to bed at once he pronounced examining the patient as
far as he could and take something for the night. Will you take it? I
got it ready some time ago... a powder.

Two if you like answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.

Its a good thing you are taking him home observed Zossimov to
Razumihin--we shall see how he is to-morrow to-day hes not at all
amiss--a considerable change since the afternoon. Live and learn...

Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?
 Razumihin blurted out as soon as they were in the street. I wont tell
you everything brother because they are such fools. Zossimov told me
to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me and
afterwards I am to tell him about it for hes got a notion in his head
that you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place
youve three times the brains he has; in the second if you are not mad
you neednt care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly
that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental
diseases and whats brought him to this conclusion about you was your
conversation to-day with Zametov.

Zametov told you all about it?

Yes and he did well. Now I understand what it all means and so does
Zametov.... Well the fact is Rodya... the point is... I am a little
drunk now.... But thats... no matter... the point is that this
idea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you
understand? That is no one ventured to say it aloud because the idea
is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter that
bubbles burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave
Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--thats between ourselves
brother; please dont let out a hint that you know of it; Ive noticed
he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovnas. But to-day to-day
its all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He
took advantage of your fainting at the police station but he is ashamed
of it himself now; I know that...

Raskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too
freely.

I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint said
Raskolnikov.

No need to explain that! And it wasnt the paint only: the fever had
been coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that! But how crushed
that boy is now you wouldnt believe! I am not worth his little
finger he says. Yours he means. He has good feelings at times
brother. But the lesson the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais
de Cristal that was too good for anything! You frightened him at first
you know he nearly went into convulsions! You almost convinced
him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense and then you
suddenly--put out your tongue at him: There now what do you make of
it? It was perfect! He is crushed annihilated now! It was masterly by
Jove its what they deserve! Ah that I wasnt there! He was hoping to
see you awfully. Porfiry too wants to make your acquaintance...

Ah!... he too... but why did they put me down as mad?

Oh not mad. I must have said too much brother.... What struck him
you see was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now its
clear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and
how that irritated you and worked in with your illness... I am a little
drunk brother only confound him he has some idea of his own... I
tell you hes mad on mental diseases. But dont you mind him...

For half a minute both were silent.

Listen Razumihin began Raskolnikov I want to tell you plainly:
Ive just been at a death-bed a clerk who died... I gave them all my
money... and besides Ive just been kissed by someone who if I had
killed anyone would just the same... in fact I saw someone else
there... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; I
am very weak support me... we shall be at the stairs directly...

Whats the matter? Whats the matter with you? Razumihin asked
anxiously.

I am a little giddy but thats not the point I am so sad so sad...
like a woman. Look whats that? Look look!

What is it?

Dont you see? A light in my room you see? Through the crack...

They were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs at the level
of the landladys door and they could as a fact see from below that
there was a light in Raskolnikovs garret.

Queer! Nastasya perhaps observed Razumihin.

She is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago
but... I dont care! Good-bye!

What do you mean? I am coming with you well come in together!

I know we are going in together but I want to shake hands here and say
good-bye to you here. So give me your hand good-bye!

Whats the matter with you Rodya?

Nothing... come along... you shall be witness.

They began mounting the stairs and the idea struck Razumihin that
perhaps Zossimov might be right after all. Ah Ive upset him with my
chatter! he muttered to himself.

When they reached the door they heard voices in the room.

What is it? cried Razumihin. Raskolnikov was the first to open the
door; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway dumbfoundered.

His mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an
hour and a half for him. Why had he never expected never thought of
them though the news that they had started were on their way and would
arrive immediately had been repeated to him only that day? They had
spent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She was
standing before them and had told them everything by now. They were
beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his running away
 to-day ill and as they understood from her story delirious! Good
Heavens what had become of him? Both had been weeping both had been
in anguish for that hour and a half.

A cry of joy of ecstasy greeted Raskolnikovs entrance. Both rushed to
him. But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck
him like a thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to embrace them he
could not. His mother and sister clasped him in their arms kissed him
laughed and cried. He took a step tottered and fell to the ground
fainting.

Anxiety cries of horror moans... Razumihin who was standing in the
doorway flew into the room seized the sick man in his strong arms and
in a moment had him on the sofa.

Its nothing nothing! he cried to the mother and sister--its only a
faint a mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said he was much better
that he is perfectly well! Water! See he is coming to himself he is
all right again!

And seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it he made
her bend down to see that he is all right again. The mother and sister
looked on him with emotion and gratitude as their Providence. They
had heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya
during his illness by this very competent young man as Pulcheria
Alexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with
Dounia.




PART III



CHAPTER I

Raskolnikov got up and sat down on the sofa. He waved his hand weakly
to Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations
he was addressing to his mother and sister took them both by the hand
and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.
His mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed an emotion
agonisingly poignant and at the same time something immovable almost
insane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.

Avdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brothers.

Go home... with him he said in a broken voice pointing to Razumihin
good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... Is it long since you
arrived?

This evening Rodya answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna the train was
awfully late. But Rodya nothing would induce me to leave you now! I
will spend the night here near you...

Dont torture me! he said with a gesture of irritation.

I will stay with him cried Razumihin I wont leave him for a
moment. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their hearts content!
My uncle is presiding there.

How how can I thank you! Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning once
more pressing Razumihins hands but Raskolnikov interrupted her again.

I cant have it! I cant have it! he repeated irritably dont worry
me! Enough go away... I cant stand it!

Come mamma come out of the room at least for a minute Dounia
whispered in dismay; we are distressing him thats evident.

Maynt I look at him after three years? wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna.

Stay he stopped them again you keep interrupting me and my ideas
get muddled.... Have you seen Luzhin?

No Rodya but he knows already of our arrival. We have heard Rodya
that Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today Pulcheria
Alexandrovna added somewhat timidly.

Yes... he was so kind... Dounia I promised Luzhin Id throw him
downstairs and told him to go to hell....

Rodya what are you saying! Surely you dont mean to tell us...
 Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm but she stopped looking at
Dounia.

Avdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother waiting
for what would come next. Both of them had heard of the quarrel from
Nastasya so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it
and were in painful perplexity and suspense.

Dounia Raskolnikov continued with an effort I dont want that
marriage so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin
so that we may never hear his name again.

Good Heavens! cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.

Brother think what you are saying! Avdotya Romanovna began
impetuously but immediately checked herself. You are not fit to talk
now perhaps; you are tired she added gently.

You think I am delirious? No... You are marrying Luzhin for _my_
sake. But I wont accept the sacrifice. And so write a letter before
to-morrow to refuse him... Let me read it in the morning and that will
be the end of it!

That I cant do! the girl cried offended what right have you...

Dounia you are hasty too be quiet to-morrow... Dont you see...
 the mother interposed in dismay. Better come away!

He is raving Razumihin cried tipsily or how would he dare!
To-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did
drive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got angry too.... He made
speeches here wanted to show off his learning and he went out
crest-fallen....

Then its true? cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.

Good-bye till to-morrow brother said Dounia compassionately--let us
go mother... Good-bye Rodya.

Do you hear sister he repeated after them making a last effort
I am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy. Let me act like
a scoundrel but you mustnt... one is enough... and though I am a
scoundrel I wouldnt own such a sister. Its me or Luzhin! Go now....

But youre out of your mind! Despot! roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov
did not and perhaps could not answer. He lay down on the sofa and
turned to the wall utterly exhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked with
interest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively
started at her glance.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.

Nothing would induce me to go she whispered in despair to Razumihin.
I will stay somewhere here... escort Dounia home.

Youll spoil everything Razumihin answered in the same whisper
losing patience--come out on to the stairs anyway. Nastasya show a
light! I assure you he went on in a half whisper on the stairs--that
he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you
understand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him so as not
to irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard but he dressed at once
and slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him at this
time of night and will do himself some mischief....

What are you saying?

And Avdotya Romanovna cant possibly be left in those lodgings without
you. Just think where you are staying! That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch
couldnt find you better lodgings... But you know Ive had a little to
drink and thats what makes me... swear; dont mind it....

But Ill go to the landlady here Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted
Ill beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night. I
cant leave him like that I cannot!

This conversation took place on the landing just before the landladys
door. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in
extraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier while he was bringing
Raskolnikov home he had indeed talked too freely but he was aware of
it himself and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he
had imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy and all that he
had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with
the two ladies seizing both by their hands persuading them and giving
them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech and at almost every
word he uttered probably to emphasise his arguments he squeezed their
hands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the
least regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out of
his huge bony paws but far from noticing what was the matter he drew
them all the closer to him. If theyd told him to jump head foremost
from the staircase he would have done it without thought or hesitation
in their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man
was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much in her anxiety
over her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential and was
unwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovna
shared her anxiety and was not of timorous disposition she could not
see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. It
was only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasyas account of her
brothers queer friend which prevented her from trying to run away from
him and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised too
that even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later
however she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of
Razumihin that he showed his true nature at once whatever mood he might
be in so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.

You cant go to the landlady thats perfect nonsense! he cried. If
you stay though you are his mother youll drive him to a frenzy and
then goodness knows what will happen! Listen Ill tell you what Ill
do: Nastasya will stay with him now and Ill conduct you both home you
cant be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that
way.... But no matter! Then Ill run straight back here and a quarter of
an hour later on my word of honour Ill bring you news how he is
whether he is asleep and all that. Then listen! Then Ill run home in
a twinkling--Ive a lot of friends there all drunk--Ill fetch
Zossimov--thats the doctor who is looking after him he is there too
but he is not drunk; he is not drunk he is never drunk! Ill drag him
to Rodya and then to you so that youll get two reports in the
hour--from the doctor you understand from the doctor himself thats a
very different thing from my account of him! If theres anything wrong
I swear Ill bring you here myself but if its all right you go to
bed. And Ill spend the night here in the passage he wont hear me
and Ill tell Zossimov to sleep at the landladys to be at hand. Which
is better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the
landlady is out of the question; its all right for me but its out of
the question for you: she wouldnt take you for shes... for shes a
fool... Shed be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you
too if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an
absolutely absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool too!...
No matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come do you trust me or not?

Let us go mother said Avdotya Romanovna he will certainly do what
he has promised. He has saved Rodya already and if the doctor really
will consent to spend the night here what could be better?

You see you... you... understand me because you are an angel!
 Razumihin cried in ecstasy let us go! Nastasya! Fly upstairs and sit
with him with a light; Ill come in a quarter of an hour.

Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced she made no
further resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down
the stairs. He still made her uneasy as though he was competent and
good-natured was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in
such a condition....

Ah I see you think I am in such a condition! Razumihin broke in upon
her thoughts guessing them as he strolled along the pavement with huge
steps so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him a fact he
did not observe however. Nonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool
but thats not it; I am not drunk from wine. Its seeing you has turned
my head... But dont mind me! Dont take any notice: I am talking
nonsense I am not worthy of you.... I am utterly unworthy of you! The
minute Ive taken you home Ill pour a couple of pailfuls of water over
my head in the gutter here and then I shall be all right.... If only
you knew how I love you both! Dont laugh and dont be angry! You may
be angry with anyone but not with me! I am his friend and therefore I
am your friend too I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last year
there was a moment... though it wasnt a presentiment really for
you seem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I shant sleep all
night... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...
thats why he mustnt be irritated.

What do you say? cried the mother.

Did the doctor really say that? asked Avdotya Romanovna alarmed.

Yes but its not so not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine a
powder I saw it and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have been
better if you had come to-morrow. Its a good thing we went away. And in
an hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is not
drunk! And I shant be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Because
they got me into an argument damn them! Ive sworn never to argue! They
talk such trash! I almost came to blows! Ive left my uncle to preside.
Would you believe they insist on complete absence of individualism
and thats just what they relish! Not to be themselves to be as unlike
themselves as they can. Thats what they regard as the highest point of
progress. If only their nonsense were their own but as it is...

Listen! Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly but it only added
fuel to the flames.

What do you think? shouted Razumihin louder than ever you think I
am attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk
nonsense. Thats mans one privilege over all creation. Through error
you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any
truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and
fourteen. And a fine thing too in its way; but we cant even make
mistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense but talk your own nonsense
and Ill kiss you for it. To go wrong in ones own way is better than
to go right in someone elses. In the first case you are a man in the
second youre no better than a bird. Truth wont escape you but life
can be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now?
In science development thought invention ideals aims liberalism
judgment experience and everything everything everything we are
still in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on other
peoples ideas its what we are used to! Am I right am I right? cried
Razumihin pressing and shaking the two ladies hands.

Oh mercy I do not know cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna.

Yes yes... though I dont agree with you in everything added Avdotya
Romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry for he squeezed her hand
so painfully.

Yes you say yes... well after that you... you... he cried in
a transport you are a fount of goodness purity sense... and
perfection. Give me your hand... you give me yours too! I want to kiss
your hands here at once on my knees... and he fell on his knees on the
pavement fortunately at that time deserted.

Leave off I entreat you what are you doing? Pulcheria Alexandrovna
cried greatly distressed.

Get up get up! said Dounia laughing though she too was upset.

Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands! Thats it! Enough! I
get up and well go on! I am a luckless fool I am unworthy of you and
drunk... and I am ashamed.... I am not worthy to love you but to do
homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! And
Ive done homage.... Here are your lodgings and for that alone Rodya
was right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away.... How dare he! how
dare he put you in such lodgings! Its a scandal! Do you know the
sort of people they take in here? And you his betrothed! You are
his betrothed? Yes? Well then Ill tell you your _fianc_ is a
scoundrel.

Excuse me Mr. Razumihin you are forgetting... Pulcheria Alexandrovna
was beginning.

Yes yes you are right I did forget myself I am ashamed of it
 Razumihin made haste to apologise. But... but you cant be angry with
me for speaking so! For I speak sincerely and not because... hm hm!
That would be disgraceful; in fact not because Im in... hm! Well
anyway I wont say why I darent.... But we all saw to-day when he
came in that that man is not of our sort. Not because he had his hair
curled at the barbers not because he was in such a hurry to show his
wit but because he is a spy a speculator because he is a skin-flint
and a buffoon. Thats evident. Do you think him clever? No he is a
fool a fool. And is he a match for you? Good heavens! Do you see
ladies? he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms though
all my friends there are drunk yet they are all honest and though we
do talk a lot of trash and I do too yet we shall talk our way to the
truth at last for we are on the right path while Pyotr Petrovitch...
is not on the right path. Though Ive been calling them all sorts of
names just now I do respect them all... though I dont respect Zametov
I like him for he is a puppy and that bullock Zossimov because he
is an honest man and knows his work. But enough its all said and
forgiven. Is it forgiven? Well then lets go on. I know this corridor
Ive been here there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are you
here? Which number? eight? Well lock yourselves in for the night then.
Dont let anybody in. In a quarter of an hour Ill come back with news
and half an hour later Ill bring Zossimov youll see! Good-bye Ill
run.

Good heavens Dounia what is going to happen? said Pulcheria
Alexandrovna addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay.

Dont worry yourself mother said Dounia taking off her hat and
cape. God has sent this gentleman to our aid though he has come from a
drinking party. We can depend on him I assure you. And all that he has
done for Rodya....

Ah. Dounia goodness knows whether he will come! How could I bring
myself to leave Rodya?... And how different how different I had fancied
our meeting! How sullen he was as though not pleased to see us....

Tears came into her eyes.

No its not that mother. You didnt see you were crying all the
time. He is quite unhinged by serious illness--thats the reason.

Ah that illness! What will happen what will happen? And how he talked
to you Dounia! said the mother looking timidly at her daughter
trying to read her thoughts and already half consoled by Dounias
standing up for her brother which meant that she had already forgiven
him. I am sure he will think better of it to-morrow she added
probing her further.

And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow... about that
 Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And of course there was no going
beyond that for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
afraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her mother. The latter
warmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to wait
anxiously for Razumihins return timidly watching her daughter who
walked up and down the room with her arms folded lost in thought.
This walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya
Romanovnas and the mother was always afraid to break in on her
daughters mood at such moments.

Razumihin of course was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation
for Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart from his eccentric condition many
people would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya
Romanovna especially at that moment when she was walking to and
fro with folded arms pensive and melancholy. Avdotya Romanovna was
remarkably good-looking; she was tall strikingly well-proportioned
strong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every
gesture though it did not in the least detract from the grace and
softness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother but she
might be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown a
little lighter than her brothers; there was a proud light in her almost
black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was
pale but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness
and vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected
a little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful
face but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty
expression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;
but how well smiles how well youthful lighthearted irresponsible
laughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm open
simple-hearted honest giant like Razumihin who had never seen anyone
like her and was not quite sober at the time should lose his head
immediately. Besides as chance would have it he saw Dounia for the
first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at
meeting him. Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation
at her brothers insolent cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was
sealed.

He had spoken the truth moreover when he blurted out in his drunken
talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna Raskolnikovs eccentric
landlady would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of
Avdotya Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
forty-three her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she
looked much younger than her age indeed which is almost always the
case with women who retain serenity of spirit sensitiveness and pure
sincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that to
preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age. Her
hair had begun to grow grey and thin there had long been little crows
foot wrinkles round her eyes her cheeks were hollow and sunken from
anxiety and grief and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dounia
over again twenty years older but without the projecting underlip.
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional but not sentimental timid and
yielding but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a
great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions but there was a
certain barrier fixed by honesty principle and the deepest convictions
which nothing would induce her to cross.

Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihins departure there came two
subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.

I wont come in I havent time he hastened to say when the door was
opened. He sleeps like a top soundly quietly and God grant he may
sleep ten hours. Nastasyas with him; I told her not to leave till I
came. Now I am fetching Zossimov he will report to you and then youd
better turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything....

And he ran off down the corridor.

What a very competent and... devoted young man! cried Pulcheria
Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted.

He seems a splendid person! Avdotya Romanovna replied with some
warmth resuming her walk up and down the room.

It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor
and another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completely
relying on Razumihins promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing
Zossimov. Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to
go to Raskolnikovs but he came reluctantly and with the greatest
suspicion to see the ladies mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated
condition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw
that they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten
minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria
Alexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy but with the reserve and
extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.
He did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the
slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two
ladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya
Romanovna he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and
addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave him
extraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought the
invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to his
observations the patients illness was due partly to his unfortunate
material surroundings during the last few months but it had partly also
a moral origin was so to speak the product of several material and
moral influences anxieties apprehensions troubles certain ideas...
and so on. Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his
words with close attention Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this
theme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovnas anxiously and timidly inquiring as
to some suspicion of insanity he replied with a composed and candid
smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient
had some fixed idea something approaching a monomania--he Zossimov
was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but
that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in
delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have
a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind if only all
fresh shocks can be avoided he added significantly. Then he got up
took leave with an impressive and affable bow while blessings warm
gratitude and entreaties were showered upon him and Avdotya Romanovna
spontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleased
with his visit and still more so with himself.

Well talk to-morrow; go to bed at once! Razumihin said in conclusion
following Zossimov out. Ill be with you to-morrow morning as early as
possible with my report.

Thats a fetching little girl Avdotya Romanovna remarked Zossimov
almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.

Fetching? You said fetching? roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov
and seized him by the throat. If you ever dare.... Do you understand?
Do you understand? he shouted shaking him by the collar and squeezing
him against the wall. Do you hear?

Let me go you drunken devil said Zossimov struggling and when he
had let him go he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.
Razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.

Of course I am an ass he observed sombre as a storm cloud but
still... you are another.

No brother not at all such another. I am not dreaming of any folly.

They walked along in silence and only when they were close to
Raskolnikovs lodgings Razumihin broke the silence in considerable
anxiety.

Listen he said youre a first-rate fellow but among your other
failings youre a loose fish that I know and a dirty one too. You
are a feeble nervous wretch and a mass of whims youre getting fat
and lazy and cant deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty because
it leads one straight into the dirt. Youve let yourself get so slack
that I dont know how it is you are still a good even a devoted doctor.
You--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your
patients! In another three or four years you wont get up for your
patients... But hang it all thats not the point!... You are going
to spend to-night in the landladys flat here. (Hard work Ive had to
persuade her!) And Ill be in the kitchen. So heres a chance for you to
get to know her better.... Its not as you think! Theres not a trace of
anything of the sort brother...!

But I dont think!

Here you have modesty brother silence bashfulness a savage
virtue... and yet shes sighing and melting like wax simply melting!
Save me from her by all thats unholy! Shes most prepossessing... Ill
repay you Ill do anything....

Zossimov laughed more violently than ever.

Well you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?

It wont be much trouble I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her
as long as you sit by her and talk. Youre a doctor too; try curing
her of something. I swear you wont regret it. She has a piano and you
know I strum a little. I have a song there a genuine Russian one: I
shed hot tears. She likes the genuine article--and well it all
began with that song; Now youre a regular performer a _matre_ a
Rubinstein.... I assure you you wont regret it!

But have you made her some promise? Something signed? A promise of
marriage perhaps?

Nothing nothing absolutely nothing of the kind! Besides she is not
that sort at all.... Tchebarov tried that....

Well then drop her!

But I cant drop her like that!

Why cant you?

Well I cant thats all about it! Theres an element of attraction
here brother.

Then why have you fascinated her?

I havent fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.
But she wont care a straw whether its you or I so long as somebody
sits beside her sighing.... I cant explain the position brother...
look here you are good at mathematics and working at it now... begin
teaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul Im not joking Im
in earnest itll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and sigh
for a whole year together. I talked to her once for two days at a time
about the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)--she
just sighed and perspired! And you mustnt talk of love--shes bashful
to hysterics--but just let her see you cant tear yourself away--thats
enough. Its fearfully comfortable; youre quite at home you can
read sit lie about write. You may even venture on a kiss if youre
careful.

But what do I want with her?

Ach I cant make you understand! You see you are made for each other!
I have often been reminded of you!... Youll come to it in the end! So
does it matter whether its sooner or later? Theres the feather-bed
element here brother--ach! and not only that! Theres an attraction
here--here you have the end of the world an anchorage a quiet haven
the navel of the earth the three fishes that are the foundation of the
world the essence of pancakes of savoury fish-pies of the evening
samovar of soft sighs and warm shawls and hot stoves to sleep on--as
snug as though you were dead and yet youre alive--the advantages
of both at once! Well hang it brother what stuff Im talking its
bedtime! Listen. I sometimes wake up at night; so Ill go in and look at
him. But theres no need its all right. Dont you worry yourself
yet if you like you might just look in once too. But if you notice
anything--delirium or fever--wake me at once. But there cant be....



CHAPTER II

Razumihin waked up next morning at eight oclock troubled and serious.
He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.
He had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He
remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly
novel experience had befallen him that he had received an impression
unlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised
clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly
unattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it and
he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties
bequeathed him by that thrice accursed yesterday.

The most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown
himself base and mean not only because he had been drunk but
because he had taken advantage of the young girls position to abuse
her _fianc_ in his stupid jealousy knowing nothing of their mutual
relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And
what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?
Who had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as
Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there
must be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know
the character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! how
despicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?
Such a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth and the
truth had all come out that is all the uncleanness of his coarse
and envious heart! And would such a dream ever be permissible to
him Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he the drunken noisy
braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical
a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and
suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had
said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of
Avdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist
down heavily on the kitchen stove hurt his hand and sent one of the
bricks flying.

Of course he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of
self-abasement of course all these infamies can never be wiped out or
smoothed over... and so its useless even to think of it and I must
go to them in silence and do my duty... in silence too... and not ask
forgiveness and say nothing... for all is lost now!

And yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.
He hadnt another suit--if he had had perhaps he wouldnt have put it
on. I would have made a point of not putting it on. But in any case he
could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend
the feelings of others especially when they were in need of his
assistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully.
His linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.

He washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--he
washed his hair his neck and especially his hands. When it came to the
question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna
had capital razors that had been left by her late husband) the question
was angrily answered in the negative. Let it stay as it is! What if
they think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think
so! Not on any account!

And... the worst of it was he was so coarse so dirty he had the
manners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had
some of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be
proud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all
the same (he remembered) he too had done little things... not exactly
dishonest and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to
set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well hed
make a point then of being dirty greasy pothouse in his manners and he
wouldnt care! Hed be worse!

He was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov who had spent the night
in Praskovya Pavlovnas parlour came in.

He was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.
Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.
Zossimov gave orders that they shouldnt wake him and promised to see
him again about eleven.

If he is still at home he added. Damn it all! If one cant control
ones patients how is one to cure them? Do you know whether _he_ will
go to them or whether _they_ are coming here?

They are coming I think said Razumihin understanding the object
of the question and they will discuss their family affairs no doubt.
Ill be off. You as the doctor have more right to be here than I.

But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; Ive plenty
to do besides looking after them.

One thing worries me interposed Razumihin frowning. On the way home
I talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and
amongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane.

You told the ladies so too.

I know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did you think so
seriously?

Thats nonsense I tell you how could I think it seriously? You
yourself described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to
him... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday you did that is with
your story about the painter; it was a nice conversation when he was
perhaps mad on that very point! If only Id known what happened then
at the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this
suspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.
These monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and
see their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember it was
Zametovs story that cleared up half the mystery to my mind. Why I
know one case in which a hypochondriac a man of forty cut the throat
of a little boy of eight because he couldnt endure the jokes he made
every day at table! And in this case his rags the insolent police
officer the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half
frantic with hypochondria and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That
may well have been the starting-point of illness. Well bother it
all!... And by the way that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow but
hm... he shouldnt have told all that last night. He is an awful
chatterbox!

But whom did he tell it to? You and me?

And Porfiry.

What does that matter?

And by the way have you any influence on them his mother and sister?
Tell them to be more careful with him to-day....

Theyll get on all right! Razumihin answered reluctantly.

Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesnt
seem to dislike him... and they havent a farthing I suppose? eh?

But what business is it of yours? Razumihin cried with annoyance. How
can I tell whether theyve a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps
youll find out....

Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last nights wine has not gone off
yet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my nights
lodging. She locked herself in made no reply to my _bonjour_ through
the door; she was up at seven oclock the samovar was taken into her
from the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview....

At nine oclock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyevs
house. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They
had risen at seven oclock or earlier. He entered looking as black as
night bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He
had reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at
him seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced
timidly at Avdotya Romanovna but her proud countenance wore at that
moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness such
complete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and
ill-disguised contempt he had expected) that it threw him into greater
confusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a
subject for conversation and he made haste to snatch at it.

Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked
Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it because
she had something which it was very very necessary to talk over
beforehand. Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation
to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya
Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter and
they asked him to bring tea which was served at last but in such
a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin
vigorously attacked the lodgings but remembering Luzhin stopped
in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovnas
questions which showered in a continual stream upon him.

He talked for three quarters of an hour being constantly interrupted
by their questions and succeeded in describing to them all the
most important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikovs life
concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted
however many things which were better omitted including the scene at
the police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly
to his story and when he thought he had finished and satisfied his
listeners he found that they considered he had hardly begun.

Tell me tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me I still dont know
your name! Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.

Dmitri Prokofitch.

I should like very very much to know Dmitri Prokofitch... how he
looks... on things in general now that is how can I explain what are
his likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me if you can
what are his hopes and so to say his dreams? Under what influences is
he now? In a word I should like...

Ah mother how can he answer all that at once? observed Dounia.

Good heavens I had not expected to find him in the least like this
Dmitri Prokofitch!

Naturally answered Razumihin. I have no mother but my uncle comes
every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me even in
appearance though he is a clever man; and your three years separation
means a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for
a year and a half; he is morose gloomy proud and haughty and of
late--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and
fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like
showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his
heart freely. Sometimes though he is not at all morbid but simply
cold and inhumanly callous; its as though he were alternating between
two characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is
so busy that everything is a hindrance and yet he lies in bed doing
nothing. He doesnt jeer at things not because he hasnt the wit but
as though he hadnt time to waste on such trifles. He never listens
to what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other
people at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps
he is right. Well what more? I think your arrival will have a most
beneficial influence upon him.

God grant it may cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna distressed by
Razumihins account of her Rodya.

And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.
He glanced at her often while he was talking but only for a moment and
looked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table listening
attentively then got up again and began walking to and fro with her
arms folded and her lips compressed occasionally putting in a question
without stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to
what was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a
white transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of
extreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed
like a queen he felt that he would not be afraid of her but perhaps
just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery
of her surroundings his heart was filled with dread and he began to be
afraid of every word he uttered every gesture he made which was very
trying for a man who already felt diffident.

Youve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brothers
character... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you
were too uncritically devoted to him observed Avdotya Romanovna with
a smile. I think you are right that he needs a womans care she added
thoughtfully.

I didnt say so; but I daresay you are right only...

What?

He loves no one and perhaps he never will Razumihin declared
decisively.

You mean he is not capable of love?

Do you know Avdotya Romanovna you are awfully like your brother in
everything indeed! he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise but
remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother
he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya
Romanovna couldnt help laughing when she looked at him.

You may both be mistaken about Rodya Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked
slightly piqued. I am not talking of our present difficulty Dounia.
What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have
supposed may be mistaken but you cant imagine Dmitri Prokofitch how
moody and so to say capricious he is. I never could depend on what
he would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might
do something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well for
instance do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave
me a shock that nearly killed me when he had the idea of marrying that
girl--what was her name--his landladys daughter?

Did you hear about that affair? asked Avdotya Romanovna.

Do you suppose---- Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. Do you
suppose that my tears my entreaties my illness my possible death from
grief our poverty would have made him pause? No he would calmly have
disregarded all obstacles. And yet it isnt that he doesnt love us!

He has never spoken a word of that affair to me Razumihin answered
cautiously. But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself
though she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was
rather strange.

And what did you hear? both the ladies asked at once.

Well nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage which
only failed to take place through the girls death was not at all to
Praskovya Pavlovnas liking. They say too the girl was not at all
pretty in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and
queer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have
had some good qualities or its quite inexplicable.... She had no money
either and he wouldnt have considered her money.... But its always
difficult to judge in such matters.

I am sure she was a good girl Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.

God forgive me I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I dont know
which of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her
or she to him Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began
tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with
Luzhin hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia obviously to
the latters annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently
caused her uneasiness even consternation. Razumihin described it in
detail again but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly
blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch not
seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.

He had planned it before his illness he added.

I think so too Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.
But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself
so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.
Avdotya Romanovna too was struck by it.

So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch? Pulcheria Alexandrovna
could not resist asking.

I can have no other opinion of your daughters future husband
 Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth and I dont say it simply
from vulgar politeness but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna
has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so
rudely of him last night it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...
mad besides; yes mad crazy I lost my head completely... and this
morning I am ashamed of it.

He crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed but did not
break the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began
to speak of Luzhin.

Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what
to do. At last faltering and continually glancing at her daughter she
confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.

You see Dmitri Prokofitch she began. Ill be perfectly open with
Dmitri Prokofitch Dounia?

Of course mother said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.

This is what it is she began in haste as though the permission to
speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. Very early this
morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter
announcing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station you
know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these
lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would
be here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.
Youd better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me
very much... you will soon see what that is and... tell me your candid
opinion Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodyas character better than
anyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia I must tell
you made her decision at once but I still dont feel sure how to act
and I... Ive been waiting for your opinion.

Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read
as follows:

Dear Madam Pulcheria Alexandrovna I have the honour to inform you
that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at
the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object
in view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with
you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of
delay and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you
are meeting your son and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have
the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings
not later than to-morrow evening at eight oclock precisely and
herewith I venture to present my earnest and I may add imperative
request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as
he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my
visit to him in his illness yesterday and moreover since I desire
from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation
upon a certain point in regard to which I wish to learn your own
interpretation. I have the honour to inform you in anticipation
that if in spite of my request I meet Rodion Romanovitch I shall be
compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to
blame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so
ill at my visit suddenly recovered two hours later and so being able
to leave the house may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief
by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who
was run over and has since died to whose daughter a young woman of
notorious behaviour he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the
funeral which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to
raise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable
daughter Avdotya Romanovna I beg you to accept the respectful homage
of

Your humble servant

P. LUZHIN.


What am I to do now Dmitri Prokofitch? began Pulcheria Alexandrovna
almost weeping. How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted
so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not
to receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows and... what will
happen then?

Act on Avdotya Romanovnas decision Razumihin answered calmly at
once.

Oh dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says she doesnt
explain her object! She says that it would be best at least not that
it would be best but that its absolutely necessary that Rodya should
make a point of being here at eight oclock and that they must meet....
I didnt want even to show him the letter but to prevent him
from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so
irritable.... Besides I dont understand about that drunkard who died
and that daughter and how he could have given the daughter all the
money... which...

Which cost you such sacrifice mother put in Avdotya Romanovna.

He was not himself yesterday Razumihin said thoughtfully if you
only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday though there
was sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something as we were going home
yesterday evening about a dead man and a girl but I didnt understand
a word.... But last night I myself...

The best thing mother will be for us to go to him ourselves and
there I assure you we shall see at once whats to be done. Besides
its getting late--good heavens its past ten she cried looking at
a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin
Venetian chain and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her
dress. A present from her _fianc_ thought Razumihin.

We must start Dounia we must start her mother cried in a flutter.
He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday from our coming
so late. Merciful heavens!

While she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;
Dounia too put on her things. Her gloves as Razumihin noticed were
not merely shabby but had holes in them and yet this evident poverty
gave the two ladies an air of special dignity which is always found in
people who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently
at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. The queen who mended her
stockings in prison he thought must have looked then every inch a
queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and leves.

My God! exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna little did I think that I
should ever fear seeing my son my darling darling Rodya! I am afraid
Dmitri Prokofitch she added glancing at him timidly.

Dont be afraid mother said Dounia kissing her better have faith
in him.

Oh dear I have faith in him but I havent slept all night
 exclaimed the poor woman.

They came out into the street.

Do you know Dounia when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of
Marfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me took
my hand and shook her head at me but so sternly as though she were
blaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh dear me! You dont know Dmitri
Prokofitch that Marfa Petrovnas dead!

No I didnt know; who is Marfa Petrovna?

She died suddenly; and only fancy...

Afterwards mamma put in Dounia. He doesnt know who Marfa Petrovna
is.

Ah you dont know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us.
Forgive me Dmitri Prokofitch I dont know what I am thinking about
these last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us and
so I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as a
relation.... Dont be angry with me for saying so. Dear me whats the
matter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?

Yes I bruised it muttered Razumihin overjoyed.

I sometimes speak too much from the heart so that Dounia finds fault
with me.... But dear me what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether
he is awake? Does this woman his landlady consider it a room? Listen
you say he does not like to show his feelings so perhaps I shall annoy
him with my... weaknesses? Do advise me Dmitri Prokofitch how am I to
treat him? I feel quite distracted you know.

Dont question him too much about anything if you see him frown; dont
ask him too much about his health; he doesnt like that.

Ah Dmitri Prokofitch how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the
stairs.... What an awful staircase!

Mother you are quite pale dont distress yourself darling said
Dounia caressing her then with flashing eyes she added: He ought to be
happy at seeing you and you are tormenting yourself so.

Wait Ill peep in and see whether he has waked up.

The ladies slowly followed Razumihin who went on before and when they
reached the landladys door on the fourth storey they noticed that her
door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching
them from the darkness within. When their eyes met the door was
suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried
out.



CHAPTER III

He is well quite well! Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.

He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place
as before on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner
fully dressed and carefully washed and combed as he had not been for
some time past. The room was immediately crowded yet Nastasya managed
to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.

Raskolnikov really was almost well as compared with his condition the
day before but he was still pale listless and sombre. He looked like
a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.
His brows were knitted his lips compressed his eyes feverish. He spoke
little and reluctantly as though performing a duty and there was a
restlessness in his movements.

He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete
the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The
pale sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister
entered but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering in
place of its listless dejection. The light soon died away but the look
of suffering remained and Zossimov watching and studying his patient
with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise noticed
in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister but a sort of
bitter hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable
torture. He saw later that almost every word of the following
conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But
at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself
and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had like a
monomaniac fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.

Yes I see myself now that I am almost well said Raskolnikov
giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria
Alexandrovna radiant at once. And I dont say this _as I did
yesterday_ he said addressing Razumihin with a friendly pressure of
his hand.

Yes indeed I am quite surprised at him to-day began Zossimov much
delighted at the ladies entrance for he had not succeeded in keeping
up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. In another three or
four days if he goes on like this he will be just as before that is
as he was a month ago or two... or perhaps even three. This has been
coming on for a long while.... eh? Confess now that it has been
perhaps your own fault? he added with a tentative smile as though
still afraid of irritating him.

It is very possible answered Raskolnikov coldly.

I should say too continued Zossimov with zest that your complete
recovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you
I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the
elementary so to speak fundamental causes tending to produce your
morbid condition: in that case you will be cured if not it will go
from bad to worse. These fundamental causes I dont know but they must
be known to you. You are an intelligent man and must have observed
yourself of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement
coincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left without
occupation and so work and a definite aim set before you might I
fancy be very beneficial.

Yes yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to
the university: and then everything will go smoothly....

Zossimov who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before
the ladies was certainly somewhat mystified when glancing at his
patient he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lasted
an instant however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking
Zossimov especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.

What! he saw you last night? Raskolnikov asked as though startled.
Then you have not slept either after your journey.

Ach Rodya that was only till two oclock. Dounia and I never go to
bed before two at home.

I dont know how to thank him either Raskolnikov went on
suddenly frowning and looking down. Setting aside the question of
payment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I
really dont know what I have done to deserve such special attention
from you! I simply dont understand it... and... and... it weighs upon
me indeed because I dont understand it. I tell you so candidly.

Dont be irritated. Zossimov forced himself to laugh. Assume that you
are my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love
our first patients as if they were our children and some almost fall in
love with them. And of course I am not rich in patients.

I say nothing about him added Raskolnikov pointing to Razumihin
though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble.

What nonsense he is talking! Why you are in a sentimental mood to-day
are you? shouted Razumihin.

If he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no
trace of sentimentality in him but something indeed quite the opposite.
But Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watching
her brother.

As for you mother I dont dare to speak he went on as though
repeating a lesson learned by heart. It is only to-day that I have
been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here
yesterday waiting for me to come back.

When he had said this he suddenly held out his hand to his sister
smiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real
unfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once and warmly pressed his
hand overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed her
since their dispute the previous day. The mothers face lighted up
with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken
reconciliation. Yes that is what I love him for Razumihin
exaggerating it all muttered to himself with a vigorous turn in his
chair. He has these movements.

And how well he does it all the mother was thinking to herself. What
generous impulses he has and how simply how delicately he put an end
to all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his
hand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what
fine eyes he has and how fine his whole face is!... He is even better
looking than Dounia.... But good heavens what a suit--how terribly
hes dressed!... Vasya the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitchs shop is
better dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but
I am afraid.... Oh dear hes so strange! Hes talking kindly but Im
afraid! Why what am I afraid of?...

Oh Rodya you wouldnt believe she began suddenly in haste to
answer his words to her how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now
that its all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can
tell you. Fancy we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace
you and that woman--ah here she is! Good morning Nastasya!... She told
us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away
from the doctor in delirium and they were looking for you in the
streets. You cant imagine how we felt! I couldnt help thinking of the
tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov a friend of your fathers--you
cant remember him Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever
and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldnt pull him out
till next day. Of course we exaggerated things. We were on the point of
rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were
alone utterly alone she said plaintively and stopped short
suddenly recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr
Petrovitch although we are quite happy again.

Yes yes.... Of course its very annoying.... Raskolnikov muttered in
reply but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed
at him in perplexity.

What else was it I wanted to say? He went on trying to recollect. Oh
yes; mother and you too Dounia please dont think that I didnt mean
to come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.

What are you saying Rodya? cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She too
was surprised.

Is he answering us as a duty? Dounia wondered. Is he being reconciled
and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating
a lesson?

Ive only just waked up and wanted to go to you but was delayed owing
to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out
the blood... Ive only just dressed.

Blood! What blood? Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.

Oh nothing--dont be uneasy. It was when I was wandering about
yesterday rather delirious I chanced upon a man who had been run
over... a clerk...

Delirious? But you remember everything! Razumihin interrupted.

Thats true Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. I
remember everything even to the slightest detail and yet--why I did
that and went there and said that I cant clearly explain now.

A familiar phenomenon interposed Zossimov actions are sometimes
performed in a masterly and most cunning way while the direction of the
actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--its
like a dream.

Perhaps its a good thing really that he should think me almost a
madman thought Raskolnikov.

Why people in perfect health act in the same way too observed
Dounia looking uneasily at Zossimov.

There is some truth in your observation the latter replied. In that
sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen but with the
slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder for we
must draw a line. A normal man it is true hardly exists. Among
dozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with.

At the word madman carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on
his favourite subject everyone frowned.

Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention plunged in thought with a
strange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.

Well what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!
 Razumihin cried hastily.

What? Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. Oh... I got spattered with
blood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way mamma I did an
unpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave
away all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. Shes
a widow now in consumption a poor creature... three little children
starving... nothing in the house... theres a daughter too... perhaps
youd have given it yourself if youd seen them. But I had no right to
do it I admit especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.
To help others one must have the right to do it or else _Crevez
chiens si vous ntes pas contents_. He laughed Thats right isnt
it Dounia?

No its not answered Dounia firmly.

Bah! you too have ideals he muttered looking at her almost with
hatred and smiling sarcastically. I ought to have considered that....
Well thats praiseworthy and its better for you... and if you reach a
line you wont overstep you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it
maybe you will be still unhappier.... But all thats nonsense he added
irritably vexed at being carried away. I only meant to say that I beg
your forgiveness mother he concluded shortly and abruptly.

Thats enough Rodya I am sure that everything you do is very good
 said his mother delighted.

Dont be too sure he answered twisting his mouth into a smile.

A silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this
conversation and in the silence and in the reconciliation and in the
forgiveness and all were feeling it.

It is as though they were afraid of me Raskolnikov was thinking
to himself looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria
Alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.

Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much flashed through
his mind.

Do you know Rodya Marfa Petrovna is dead Pulcheria Alexandrovna
suddenly blurted out.

What Marfa Petrovna?

Oh mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna Svidrigalov. I wrote you so much about
her.

A-a-h! Yes I remember.... So shes dead! Oh really? he roused
himself suddenly as if waking up. What did she die of?

Only imagine quite suddenly Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered
hurriedly encouraged by his curiosity. On the very day I was sending
you that letter! Would you believe it that awful man seems to have been
the cause of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully.

Why were they on such bad terms? he asked addressing his sister.

Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her he was always very
patient considerate even. In fact all those seven years of their
married life he gave way to her too much so indeed in many cases. All
of a sudden he seems to have lost patience.

Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven
years? You seem to be defending him Dounia?

No no hes an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful! Dounia
answered almost with a shudder knitting her brows and sinking into
thought.

That had happened in the morning Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on
hurriedly. And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be
harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used
to drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner I am
told....

After the beating?

That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner so as not
to be late in starting she went to the bath-house.... You see she was
undergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there and
she used to bathe in it regularly every day and no sooner had she got
into the water when she suddenly had a stroke!

I should think so said Zossimov.

And did he beat her badly?

What does that matter! put in Dounia.

Hm! But I dont know why you want to tell us such gossip mother
 said Raskolnikov irritably as it were in spite of himself.

Ah my dear I dont know what to talk about broke from Pulcheria
Alexandrovna.

Why are you all afraid of me? he asked with a constrained smile.

Thats certainly true said Dounia looking directly and sternly at
her brother. Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the
stairs.

His face worked as though in convulsion.

Ach what are you saying Dounia! Dont be angry please Rodya....
Why did you say that Dounia? Pulcheria Alexandrovna began
overwhelmed--You see coming here I was dreaming all the way in the
train how we should meet how we should talk over everything
together.... And I was so happy I did not notice the journey! But what
am I saying? I am happy now.... You should not Dounia.... I am happy
now--simply in seeing you Rodya....

Hush mother he muttered in confusion not looking at her but
pressing her hand. We shall have time to speak freely of everything!

As he said this he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned
pale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly
chill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to
him that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be
able to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to
_speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such that
for a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat and not
looking at anyone walked towards the door.

What are you about? cried Razumihin clutching him by the arm.

He sat down again and began looking about him in silence. They were
all looking at him in perplexity.

But what are you all so dull for? he shouted suddenly and quite
unexpectedly. Do say something! Whats the use of sitting like this?
Come do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....
Come anything!

Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning
again said Pulcheria Alexandrovna crossing herself.

What is the matter Rodya? asked Avdotya Romanovna distrustfully.

Oh nothing! I remembered something he answered and suddenly
laughed.

Well if you remembered something; thats all right!... I was beginning
to think... muttered Zossimov getting up from the sofa. It is time
for me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can... He made
his bows and went out.

What an excellent man! observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.

Yes excellent splendid well-educated intelligent Raskolnikov
began suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity and a liveliness he
had not shown till then. I cant remember where I met him before my
illness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good
man too he nodded at Razumihin. Do you like him Dounia? he asked
her; and suddenly for some unknown reason laughed.

Very much answered Dounia.

Foo!--what a pig you are! Razumihin protested blushing in terrible
confusion and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled
faintly but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.

Where are you off to?

I must go.

You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone so you must. Dont go.
Whats the time? Is it twelve oclock? What a pretty watch you have got
Dounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking.

It was a present from Marfa Petrovna answered Dounia.

And a very expensive one! added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.

A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a ladys.

I like that sort said Dounia.

So it is not a present from her _fianc_ thought Razumihin and was
unreasonably delighted.

I thought it was Luzhins present observed Raskolnikov.

No he has not made Dounia any presents yet.

A-ah! And do you remember mother I was in love and wanted to get
married? he said suddenly looking at his mother who was disconcerted
by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.

Oh yes my dear.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.

Hm yes. What shall I tell you? I dont remember much indeed. She was
such a sickly girl he went on growing dreamy and looking down again.
Quite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor and was
always dreaming of a nunnery and once she burst into tears when she
began talking to me about it. Yes yes I remember. I remember very
well. She was an ugly little thing. I really dont know what drew me
to her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had been
lame or hunchback I believe I should have liked her better still he
smiled dreamily. Yes it was a sort of spring delirium.

No it was not only spring delirium said Dounia with warm feeling.

He fixed a strained intent look on his sister but did not hear or did
not understand her words. Then completely lost in thought he got up
went up to his mother kissed her went back to his place and sat down.

You love her even now? said Pulcheria Alexandrovna touched.

Her? Now? Oh yes.... You ask about her? No... thats all now as
it were in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything
happening here seems somehow far away. He looked attentively at them.
You now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...
but goodness knows why we are talking of that! And whats the use of
asking about it? he added with annoyance and biting his nails fell
into dreamy silence again.

What a wretched lodging you have Rodya! Its like a tomb said
Pulcheria Alexandrovna suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. I
am sure its quite half through your lodging you have become so
melancholy.

My lodging he answered listlessly. Yes the lodging had a great
deal to do with it.... I thought that too.... If only you knew though
what a strange thing you said just now mother he said laughing
strangely.

A little more and their companionship this mother and this sister
with him after three years absence this intimate tone of conversation
in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything
would have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent
matter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had
decided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it as a means of
escape.

Listen Dounia he began gravely and drily of course I beg your
pardon for yesterday but I consider it my duty to tell you again that
I do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a
scoundrel you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin I cease
at once to look on you as a sister.

Rodya Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again Pulcheria
Alexandrovna cried mournfully. And why do you call yourself a
scoundrel? I cant bear it. You said the same yesterday.

Brother Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. In all
this there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night
and found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am
sacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at
all. I am simply marrying for my own sake because things are hard for
me. Though of course I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to
my family. But that is not the chief motive for my decision....

She is lying he thought to himself biting his nails vindictively.
Proud creature! She wont admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too
haughty! Oh base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh
how I... hate them all!

In fact continued Dounia I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of
two evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of
me so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now? She too
flushed and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.

All? he asked with a malignant grin.

Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitchs
courtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may of course think too
well of himself but I hope he esteems me too.... Why are you laughing
again?

And why are you blushing again? You are lying sister. You are
intentionally lying simply from feminine obstinacy simply to hold your
own against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked
with him. So you are selling yourself for money and so in any case you
are acting basely and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.

It is not true. I am not lying cried Dounia losing her composure.
I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me
and thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly
convinced that I can respect him. Fortunately I can have convincing
proof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness as
you say! And even if you were right if I really had determined on a
vile action is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?
Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It
is despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone it is only myself.... I
am not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you
so pale? Rodya darling whats the matter?

Good heavens! You have made him faint cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.

No no nonsense! Its nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You
have fainting on the brain. Hm yes what was I saying? Oh yes. In
what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him
and that he... esteems you as you said. I think you said to-day?

Mother show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitchs letter said Dounia.

With trembling hands Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He
took it with great interest but before opening it he suddenly looked
with a sort of wonder at Dounia.

It is strange he said slowly as though struck by a new idea. What
am I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!

He said this as though to himself but said it aloud and looked for
some time at his sister as though puzzled. He opened the letter at
last still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then
slowly and attentively he began reading and read it through twice.
Pulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety and all indeed expected
something particular.

What surprises me he began after a short pause handing the letter
to his mother but not addressing anyone in particular is that he is a
business man a lawyer and his conversation is pretentious indeed and
yet he writes such an uneducated letter.

They all started. They had expected something quite different.

But they all write like that you know Razumihin observed abruptly.

Have you read it?

Yes.

We showed him Rodya. We... consulted him just now Pulcheria
Alexandrovna began embarrassed.

Thats just the jargon of the courts Razumihin put in. Legal
documents are written like that to this day.

Legal? Yes its just legal--business language--not so very uneducated
and not quite educated--business language!

Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap
education he is proud indeed of having made his own way Avdotya
Romanovna observed somewhat offended by her brothers tone.

Well if hes proud of it he has reason I dont deny it. You seem to
be offended sister at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the
letter and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to
annoy you. It is quite the contrary an observation apropos of the style
occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There
is one expression blame yourselves put in very significantly and
plainly and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I
am present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon
you both if you are disobedient and to abandon you now after summoning
you to Petersburg. Well what do you think? Can one resent such an
expression from Luzhin as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had
written it or Zossimov or one of us?

N-no answered Dounia with more animation. I saw clearly that it
was too navely expressed and that perhaps he simply has no skill
in writing... that is a true criticism brother. I did not expect
indeed...

It is expressed in legal style and sounds coarser than perhaps he
intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression
in the letter one slander about me and rather a contemptible one. I
gave the money last night to the widow a woman in consumption crushed
with trouble and not on the pretext of the funeral but simply to pay
for the funeral and not to the daughter--a young woman as he writes
of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my
life)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander
me and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal
jargon that is to say with a too obvious display of the aim and
with a very nave eagerness. He is a man of intelligence but to act
sensibly intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... I
dont think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to
warn you because I sincerely wish for your good...

Dounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only
awaiting the evening.

Then what is your decision Rodya? asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna who
was more uneasy than ever at the sudden new businesslike tone of his
talk.

What decision?

You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this
evening and that he will go away if you come. So will you... come?

That of course is not for me to decide but for you first if you are
not offended by such a request; and secondly by Dounia if she too is
not offended. I will do what you think best he added drily.

Dounia has already decided and I fully agree with her Pulcheria
Alexandrovna hastened to declare.

I decided to ask you Rodya to urge you not to fail to be with us at
this interview said Dounia. Will you come?

Yes.

I will ask you too to be with us at eight oclock she said
addressing Razumihin. Mother I am inviting him too.

Quite right Dounia. Well since you have decided added Pulcheria
Alexandrovna so be it. I shall feel easier myself. I do not like
concealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr
Petrovitch may be angry or not now!



CHAPTER IV

At that moment the door was softly opened and a young girl walked into
the room looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with
surprise and curiosity. At first sight Raskolnikov did not recognise
her. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for
the first time but at such a moment in such surroundings and in such
a dress that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she
was a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl very young indeed
almost like a child with a modest and refined manner with a candid but
somewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor
dress and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat but she still carried a
parasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people she was not so
much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness like a
little child. She was even about to retreat. Oh... its you! said
Raskolnikov extremely astonished and he too was confused. He at once
recollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhins letter
of some young woman of notorious behaviour. He had only just been
protesting against Luzhins calumny and declaring that he had seen the
girl last night for the first time and suddenly she had walked in. He
remembered too that he had not protested against the expression of
notorious behaviour. All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through
his brain but looking at her more intently he saw that the humiliated
creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she
made a movement to retreat in terror it sent a pang to his heart.

I did not expect you he said hurriedly with a look that made her
stop. Please sit down. You come no doubt from Katerina Ivanovna.
Allow me--not there. Sit here....

At Sonias entrance Razumihin who had been sitting on one of
Raskolnikovs three chairs close to the door got up to allow her to
enter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where
Zossimov had been sitting but feeling that the sofa which served him
as a bed was too _familiar_ a place he hurriedly motioned her to
Razumihins chair.

You sit here he said to Razumihin putting him on the sofa.

Sonia sat down almost shaking with terror and looked timidly at the
two ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she
could sit down beside them. At the thought of it she was so frightened
that she hurriedly got up again and in utter confusion addressed
Raskolnikov.

I... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you she
began falteringly. I come from Katerina Ivanovna and she had no one to
send. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in
the morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...
to do her the honour... she told me to beg you... Sonia stammered and
ceased speaking.

I will try certainly most certainly answered Raskolnikov. He
too stood up and he too faltered and could not finish his sentence.
Please sit down he said suddenly. I want to talk to you. You are
perhaps in a hurry but please be so kind spare me two minutes and
he drew up a chair for her.

Sonia sat down again and again timidly she took a hurried frightened
look at the two ladies and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikovs pale face
flushed a shudder passed over him his eyes glowed.

Mother he said firmly and insistently this is Sofya Semyonovna
Marmeladov the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov who was run
over yesterday before my eyes and of whom I was just telling you.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia and slightly screwed up
her eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodyas urgent and
challenging look she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Dounia
gazed gravely and intently into the poor girls face and scrutinised
her with perplexity. Sonia hearing herself introduced tried to raise
her eyes again but was more embarrassed than ever.

I wanted to ask you said Raskolnikov hastily how things were
arranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police for instance?

No that was all right... it was too evident the cause of death...
they did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry.

Why?

At the bodys remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that
to-day they will carry it to the cemetery into the chapel until
to-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling but now she sees
herself that its necessary...

To-day then?

She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the
service and then to be present at the funeral lunch.

She is giving a funeral lunch?

Yes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping
us yesterday. But for you we should have had nothing for the funeral.

All at once her lips and chin began trembling but with an effort she
controlled herself looking down again.

During the conversation Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a
thin very thin pale little face rather irregular and angular with a
sharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty but
her blue eyes were so clear and when they lighted up there was such
a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help
being attracted. Her face and her whole figure indeed had another
peculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years she looked
almost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures this
childishness seemed almost absurd.

But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?
Does she even mean to have a funeral lunch? Raskolnikov asked
persistently keeping up the conversation.

The coffin will be plain of course... and everything will be plain so
it wont cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out so
that there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious
it should be so. You know one cant... its a comfort to her... she is
like that you know....

I understand I understand... of course... why do you look at my room
like that? My mother has just said it is like a tomb.

You gave us everything yesterday Sonia said suddenly in reply in a
loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lips
and chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at once
by Raskolnikovs poor surroundings and now these words broke out
spontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Dounias eyes
and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.

Rodya she said getting up we shall have dinner together of
course. Come Dounia.... And you Rodya had better go for a little
walk and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... I am
afraid we have exhausted you....

Yes yes Ill come he answered getting up fussily. But I have
something to see to.

But surely you will have dinner together? cried Razumihin looking in
surprise at Raskolnikov. What do you mean?

Yes yes I am coming... of course of course! And you stay a minute.
You do not want him just now do you mother? Or perhaps I am taking him
from you?

Oh no no. And will you Dmitri Prokofitch do us the favour of dining
with us?

Please do added Dounia.

Razumihin bowed positively radiant. For one moment they were all
strangely embarrassed.

Good-bye Rodya that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.
Good-bye Nastasya. Ah I have said good-bye again.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia too; but it somehow failed
to come off and she went in a flutter out of the room.

But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn and following her mother
out gave Sonia an attentive courteous bow. Sonia in confusion gave
a hurried frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort
in her face as though Avdotya Romanovnas courtesy and attention were
oppressive and painful to her.

Dounia good-bye called Raskolnikov in the passage. Give me your
hand.

Why I did give it to you. Have you forgotten? said Dounia turning
warmly and awkwardly to him.

Never mind give it to me again. And he squeezed her fingers warmly.

Dounia smiled flushed pulled her hand away and went off quite happy.

Come thats capital he said to Sonia going back and looking
brightly at her. God give peace to the dead the living have still to
live. That is right isnt it?

Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He looked
at her for some moments in silence. The whole history of the dead father
floated before his memory in those moments....

*****

Heavens Dounia Pulcheria Alexandrovna began as soon as they were in
the street I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.
How little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad
of that.

I tell you again mother he is still very ill. Dont you see it?
Perhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient and much much
can be forgiven.

Well you were not very patient! Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up
hotly and jealously. Do you know Dounia I was looking at you two. You
are the very portrait of him and not so much in face as in soul. You
are both melancholy both morose and hot-tempered both haughty and both
generous.... Surely he cant be an egoist Dounia. Eh? When I think of
what is in store for us this evening my heart sinks!

Dont be uneasy mother. What must be will be.

Dounia only think what a position we are in! What if Pyotr Petrovitch
breaks it off? poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out incautiously.

He wont be worth much if he does answered Dounia sharply and
contemptuously.

We did well to come away Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in.
He was in a hurry about some business or other. If he gets out and has
a breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... But where is
one to get a breath of air here? The very streets here feel like shut-up
rooms. Good heavens! what a town!... stay... this side... they will
crush you--carrying something. Why it is a piano they have got I
declare... how they push!... I am very much afraid of that young woman
too.

What young woman mother?

Why that Sofya Semyonovna who was there just now.

Why?

I have a presentiment Dounia. Well you may believe it or not but
as soon as she came in that very minute I felt that she was the chief
cause of the trouble....

Nothing of the sort! cried Dounia in vexation. What nonsense with
your presentiments mother! He only made her acquaintance the evening
before and he did not know her when she came in.

Well you will see.... She worries me; but you will see you will
see! I was so frightened. She was gazing at me with those eyes. I could
scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her do you
remember? It seems so strange but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that
about her and he introduces her to us--to you! So he must think a great
deal of her.

People will write anything. We were talked about and written about
too. Have you forgotten? I am sure that she is a good girl and that it
is all nonsense.

God grant it may be!

And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer Dounia snapped out
suddenly.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed.

*****

I will tell you what I want with you said Raskolnikov drawing
Razumihin to the window.

Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming Sonia said
hurriedly preparing to depart.

One minute Sofya Semyonovna. We have no secrets. You are not in our
way. I want to have another word or two with you. Listen! he turned
suddenly to Razumihin again. You know that... whats his name...
Porfiry Petrovitch?

I should think so! He is a relation. Why? added the latter with
interest.

Is not he managing that case... you know about that murder?... You
were speaking about it yesterday.

Yes... well? Razumihins eyes opened wide.

He was inquiring for people who had pawned things and I have some
pledges there too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when
I left home and my fathers silver watch--they are only worth five or
six roubles altogether... but I value them. So what am I to do now? I
do not want to lose the things especially the watch. I was quaking just
now for fear mother would ask to look at it when we spoke of Dounias
watch. It is the only thing of fathers left us. She would be ill if
it were lost. You know what women are. So tell me what to do. I know I
ought to have given notice at the police station but would it not be
better to go straight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The matter
might be settled more quickly. You see mother may ask for it before
dinner.

Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry Razumihin
shouted in extraordinary excitement. Well how glad I am. Let us go at
once. It is a couple of steps. We shall be sure to find him.

Very well let us go.

And he will be very very glad to make your acquaintance. I have
often talked to him of you at different times. I was speaking of you
yesterday. Let us go. So you knew the old woman? So thats it! It is all
turning out splendidly.... Oh yes Sofya Ivanovna...

Sofya Semyonovna corrected Raskolnikov. Sofya Semyonovna this is my
friend Razumihin and he is a good man.

If you have to go now Sonia was beginning not looking at Razumihin
at all and still more embarrassed.

Let us go decided Raskolnikov. I will come to you to-day Sofya
Semyonovna. Only tell me where you live.

He was not exactly ill at ease but seemed hurried and avoided her
eyes. Sonia gave her address and flushed as she did so. They all went
out together.

Dont you lock up? asked Razumihin following him on to the stairs.

Never answered Raskolnikov. I have been meaning to buy a lock for
these two years. People are happy who have no need of locks he said
laughing to Sonia. They stood still in the gateway.

Do you go to the right Sofya Semyonovna? How did you find me by the
way? he added as though he wanted to say something quite different. He
wanted to look at her soft clear eyes but this was not easy.

Why you gave your address to Polenka yesterday.

Polenka? Oh yes; Polenka that is the little girl. She is your sister?
Did I give her the address?

Why had you forgotten?

No I remember.

I had heard my father speak of you... only I did not know your name
and he did not know it. And now I came... and as I had learnt your name
I asked to-day Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live? I did not know you
had only a room too.... Good-bye I will tell Katerina Ivanovna.

She was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down
hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible to walk the twenty
steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone and then
moving rapidly along looking at no one noticing nothing to think to
remember to meditate on every word every detail. Never never had she
felt anything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was
opening before her. She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to
come to her that day perhaps at once!

Only not to-day please not to-day! she kept muttering with a sinking
heart as though entreating someone like a frightened child. Mercy! to
me... to that room... he will see... oh dear!

She was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who
was watching her and following at her heels. He had accompanied her from
the gateway. At the moment when Razumihin Raskolnikov and she stood
still at parting on the pavement this gentleman who was just passing
started on hearing Sonias words: and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov
lived? He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three especially
upon Raskolnikov to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted
the house. All this was done in an instant as he passed and trying not
to betray his interest he walked on more slowly as though waiting for
something. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting and
that Sonia was going home.

Home? Where? Ive seen that face somewhere he thought. I must find
out.

At the turning he crossed over looked round and saw Sonia coming the
same way noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her on
the other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again overtook
her and kept two or three yards behind her.

He was a man about fifty rather tall and thickly set with broad high
shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He wore
good and fashionable clothes and looked like a gentleman of position.
He carried a handsome cane which he tapped on the pavement at each
step; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad rather pleasant face
with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour not often seen in Petersburg.
His flaxen hair was still abundant and only touched here and there with
grey and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.
His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were
crimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger
than his years.

When Sonia came out on the canal bank they were the only two persons on
the pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching
the house where she lodged Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed
her seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the right
corner. Bah! muttered the unknown gentleman and mounted the stairs
behind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey
turned down the passage and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed
in chalk Kapernaumov Tailor. Bah! the stranger repeated again
wondering at the strange coincidence and he rang next door at No. 8.
The doors were two or three yards apart.

You lodge at Kapernaumovs he said looking at Sonia and laughing.
He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here at
Madame Resslichs. How odd! Sonia looked at him attentively.

We are neighbours he went on gaily. I only came to town the day
before yesterday. Good-bye for the present.

Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt for
some reason ashamed and uneasy.

*****

On the way to Porfirys Razumihin was obviously excited.

Thats capital brother he repeated several times and I am glad! I
am glad!

What are you glad about? Raskolnikov thought to himself.

I didnt know that you pledged things at the old womans too. And...
was it long ago? I mean was it long since you were there?

What a simple-hearted fool he is!

When was it? Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. Two or three
days before her death it must have been. But I am not going to redeem
the things now he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous
solicitude about the things. Ive not more than a silver rouble
left... after last nights accursed delirium!

He laid special emphasis on the delirium.

Yes yes Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. Then
thats why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you
were continually mentioning some rings or chains! Yes yes... thats
clear its all clear now.

Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. Here this man will
go to the stake for me and I find him delighted at having it _cleared
up_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium! What a hold the idea must have
on all of them!

Shall we find him? he asked suddenly.

Oh yes Razumihin answered quickly. He is a nice fellow you will
see brother. Rather clumsy that is to say he is a man of polished
manners but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligent
fellow very much so indeed but he has his own range of ideas.... He
is incredulous sceptical cynical... he likes to impose on people or
rather to make fun of them. His is the old circumstantial method....
But he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a
case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very very
anxious to make your acquaintance!

On what grounds is he so anxious?

Oh its not exactly... you see since youve been ill I happen to have
mentioned you several times.... So when he heard about you... about
your being a law student and not able to finish your studies he said
What a pity! And so I concluded... from everything together not only
that; yesterday Zametov... you know Rodya I talked some nonsense on
the way home to you yesterday when I was drunk... I am afraid brother
of your exaggerating it you see.

What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right he said
with a constrained smile.

Yes yes.... That is pooh no!... But all that I said (and there was
something else too) it was all nonsense drunken nonsense.

But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all! Raskolnikov cried
with exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed however.

I know I know I understand. Believe me I understand. Ones ashamed
to speak of it.

If you are ashamed then dont speak of it.

Both were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov
perceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed too by what Razumihin had
just said about Porfiry.

I shall have to pull a long face with him too he thought with a
beating heart and he turned white and do it naturally too. But the
most natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothing
at all! No _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh well we
shall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a good
thing to go or not? The butterfly flies to the light. My heart is
beating thats whats bad!

In this grey house said Razumihin.

The most important thing does Porfiry know that I was at the old
hags flat yesterday... and asked about the blood? I must find that out
instantly as soon as I go in find out from his face; otherwise... Ill
find out if its my ruin.

I say brother he said suddenly addressing Razumihin with a sly
smile I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously
excited. Isnt it so?

Excited? Not a bit of it said Razumihin stung to the quick.

Yes brother I assure you its noticeable. Why you sat on your chair
in a way you never do sit on the edge somehow and you seemed to be
writhing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you
were angry and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even
blushed; especially when you were invited to dinner you blushed
awfully.

Nothing of the sort nonsense! What do you mean?

But why are you wriggling out of it like a schoolboy? By Jove there
hes blushing again.

What a pig you are!

But why are you so shamefaced about it? Romeo! Stay Ill tell of you
to-day. Ha-ha-ha! Ill make mother laugh and someone else too...

Listen listen listen this is serious.... What next you fiend!
 Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed turning cold with horror. What will
you tell them? Come brother... foo! what a pig you are!

You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how it suits you; a
Romeo over six foot high! And how youve washed to-day--you cleaned your
nails I declare. Eh? Thats something unheard of! Why I do believe
youve got pomatum on your hair! Bend down.

Pig!

Raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself. So
laughing they entered Porfiry Petrovitchs flat. This is what
Raskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they
came in still guffawing in the passage.

Not a word here or Ill... brain you! Razumihin whispered furiously
seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder.



CHAPTER V

Raskolnikov was already entering the room. He came in looking as though
he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again. Behind him
Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward shamefaced and red as a peony
with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face and
whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified
Raskolnikovs laughter. Raskolnikov not waiting for an introduction
bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch who stood in the middle of the room
looking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands still
apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few
words to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming
a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as
though accidentally at Razumihin and could no longer control himself:
his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried
to restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received
this spontaneous mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most
genuine fun and naturalness. Razumihin strengthened this impression as
though on purpose.

Fool! You fiend he roared waving his arm which at once struck a
little round table with an empty tea-glass on it. Everything was sent
flying and crashing.

But why break chairs gentlemen? You know its a loss to the Crown
 Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.

Raskolnikov was still laughing with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitchs
but anxious not to overdo it awaited the right moment to put a natural
end to it. Razumihin completely put to confusion by upsetting the table
and smashing the glass gazed gloomily at the fragments cursed and
turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back
to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance seeing nothing.
Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing but
obviously looked for explanations. Zametov had been sitting in the
corner but he rose at the visitors entrance and was standing in
expectation with a smile on his lips though he looked with surprise and
even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a
certain embarrassment. Zametovs unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov
unpleasantly.

Ive got to think of that he thought. Excuse me please he began
affecting extreme embarrassment. Raskolnikov.

Not at all very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly youve come
in.... Why wont he even say good-morning? Porfiry Petrovitch nodded
at Razumihin.

Upon my honour I dont know why he is in such a rage with me. I only
told him as we came along that he was like Romeo... and proved it. And
that was all I think!

Pig! ejaculated Razumihin without turning round.

There must have been very grave grounds for it if he is so furious at
the word Porfiry laughed.

Oh you sharp lawyer!... Damn you all! snapped Razumihin and suddenly
bursting out laughing himself he went up to Porfiry with a more
cheerful face as though nothing had happened. Thatll do! We are
all fools. To come to business. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch
Raskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make
your acquaintance and secondly he has a little matter of business with
you. Bah! Zametov what brought you here? Have you met before? Have you
known each other long?

What does this mean? thought Raskolnikov uneasily.

Zametov seemed taken aback but not very much so.

Why it was at your rooms we met yesterday he said easily.

Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging me
to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out
without me. Where is your tobacco?

Porfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown very clean linen and
trodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty short
stout even to corpulence and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short
and had a large round head particularly prominent at the back. His
soft round rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour
but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been
good-natured except for a look in the eyes which shone with a watery
mawkish light under almost white blinking eyelashes. The expression
of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish
figure and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at
first sight.

As soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter
of business with him he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down
himself on the other end waiting for him to explain his business with
that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and
embarrassing especially to a stranger and especially if what you are
discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such
exceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov
explained his business clearly and exactly and was so well satisfied
with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.
Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin
sitting opposite at the same table listened warmly and impatiently
looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive
interest.

Fool Raskolnikov swore to himself.

You have to give information to the police Porfiry replied with a
most businesslike air that having learnt of this incident that is of
the murder you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such
and such things belong to you and that you desire to redeem them...
or... but they will write to you.

Thats just the point that at the present moment Raskolnikov tried
his utmost to feign embarrassment I am not quite in funds... and
even this trifling sum is beyond me... I only wanted you see for
the present to declare that the things are mine and that when I have
money....

Thats no matter answered Porfiry Petrovitch receiving his
explanation of his pecuniary position coldly but you can if you
prefer write straight to me to say that having been informed of the
matter and claiming such and such as your property you beg...

On an ordinary sheet of paper? Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly again
interested in the financial side of the question.

Oh the most ordinary and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with
obvious irony at him screwing up his eyes and as it were winking at
him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikovs fancy for it all lasted but a
moment. There was certainly something of the sort Raskolnikov could
have sworn he winked at him goodness knows why.

He knows flashed through his mind like lightning.

Forgive my troubling you about such trifles he went on a little
disconcerted the things are only worth five roubles but I prize them
particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me and I must
confess that I was alarmed when I heard...

Thats why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that
Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges! Razumihin put in
with obvious intention.

This was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him
with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes but immediately
recollected himself.

You seem to be jeering at me brother? he said to him with a
well-feigned irritability. I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious
about such trash; but you mustnt think me selfish or grasping for that
and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you
just now that the silver watch though its not worth a cent is the
only thing left us of my fathers. You may laugh at me but my mother is
here he turned suddenly to Porfiry and if she knew he turned again
hurriedly to Razumihin carefully making his voice tremble that the
watch was lost she would be in despair! You know what women are!

Not a bit of it! I didnt mean that at all! Quite the contrary!
 shouted Razumihin distressed.

Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it? Raskolnikov asked
himself in a tremor. Why did I say that about women?

Oh your mother is with you? Porfiry Petrovitch inquired.

Yes.

When did she come?

Last night.

Porfiry paused as though reflecting.

Your things would not in any case be lost he went on calmly and
coldly. I have been expecting you here for some time.

And as though that was a matter of no importance he carefully offered
the ash-tray to Razumihin who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash
over the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered but Porfiry did not seem to be
looking at him and was still concerned with Razumihins cigarette.

What? Expecting him? Why did you know that he had pledges _there_?
 cried Razumihin.

Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.

Your things the ring and the watch were wrapped up together and on
the paper your name was legibly written in pencil together with the
date on which you left them with her...

How observant you are! Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly doing his very
utmost to look him straight in the face but he failed and suddenly
added:

I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that it
must be difficult to remember them all.... But you remember them all so
clearly and... and...

Stupid! Feeble! he thought. Why did I add that?

But we know all who had pledges and you are the only one who hasnt
come forward Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.

I havent been quite well.

I heard that too. I heard indeed that you were in great distress
about something. You look pale still.

I am not pale at all.... No I am quite well Raskolnikov snapped
out rudely and angrily completely changing his tone. His anger was
mounting he could not repress it. And in my anger I shall betray
myself flashed through his mind again. Why are they torturing me?

Not quite well! Razumihin caught him up. What next! He was
unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe Porfiry as
soon as our backs were turned he dressed though he could hardly stand
and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight
delirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!

Really delirious? You dont say so! Porfiry shook his head in a
womanish way.

Nonsense! Dont you believe it! But you dont believe it anyway
 Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem
to catch those strange words.

But how could you have gone out if you hadnt been delirious?
 Razumihin got hot suddenly. What did you go out for? What was the
object of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did
it? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly.

I was awfully sick of them yesterday. Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry
suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance I ran away from them to
take lodgings where they wouldnt find me and took a lot of money with
me. Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say Mr. Zametov was I sensible or
delirious yesterday; settle our dispute.

He could have strangled Zametov at that moment so hateful were his
expression and his silence to him.

In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully but you were
extremely irritable Zametov pronounced dryly.

And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day put in Porfiry Petrovitch
that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had
been run over.

And there said Razumihin werent you mad then? You gave your last
penny to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help give fifteen
or twenty even but keep three roubles for yourself at least but he
flung away all the twenty-five at once!

Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So
thats why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows Ive found a
treasure! Excuse us please for disturbing you for half an hour
with such trivialities he said turning to Porfiry Petrovitch with
trembling lips. We are boring you arent we?

Oh no quite the contrary quite the contrary! If only you knew how you
interest me! Its interesting to look on and listen... and I am really
glad you have come forward at last.

But you might give us some tea! My throats dry cried Razumihin.

Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldnt you
like... something more essential before tea?

Get along with you!

Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.

Raskolnikovs thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.

The worst of it is they dont disguise it; they dont care to stand on
ceremony! And how if you didnt know me at all did you come to talk
to Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they dont care to hide that they are
tracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face. He was
shaking with rage. Come strike me openly dont play with me like a
cat with a mouse. Its hardly civil Porfiry Petrovitch but perhaps I
wont allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly
faces and youll see how I despise you. He could hardly breathe.
And what if its only my fancy? What if I am mistaken and through
inexperience I get angry and dont keep up my nasty part? Perhaps its
all unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones but there is
something about them.... It all might be said but there is something.
Why did he say bluntly With her? Why did Zametov add that I spoke
artfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes the tone.... Razumihin
is sitting here why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never
does see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of
course its nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset
my nerves or are they teasing me? Either its ill fancy or they know!
Even Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind.
I foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here while its my
first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back
to him. Theyre as thick as thieves no doubt over me! Not a doubt they
were talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If
only theyd make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he
let it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat it may be of use
afterwards.... Delirious indeed... ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last
night! He didnt know of my mothers arrival! The hag had written the
date on in pencil! You are wrong you wont catch me! There are no
facts... its all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isnt a
fact but delirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the
flat? I wont go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being
angry now maybe is a fact! Fool how irritable I am! Perhaps thats
right; to play the invalid.... He is feeling me. He will try to catch
me. Why did I come?

All this flashed like lightning through his mind.

Porfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became suddenly more jovial.

Your party yesterday brother has left my head rather.... And I am out
of sorts altogether he began in quite a different tone laughing to
Razumihin.

Was it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.
Who got the best of it?

Oh no one of course. They got on to everlasting questions floated
off into space.

Only fancy Rodya what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a
thing as crime. I told you that we talked our heads off.

What is there strange? Its an everyday social question Raskolnikov
answered casually.

The question wasnt put quite like that observed Porfiry.

Not quite thats true Razumihin agreed at once getting warm and
hurried as usual. Listen Rodion and tell us your opinion I want to
hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to
help me. I told them you were coming.... It began with the socialist
doctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the
abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more and nothing
more; no other causes admitted!...

You are wrong there cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably
animated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin which made him
more excited than ever.

Nothing is admitted Razumihin interrupted with heat.

I am not wrong. Ill show you their pamphlets. Everything with them
is the influence of environment and nothing else. Their favourite
phrase! From which it follows that if society is normally organised
all crime will cease at once since there will be nothing to protest
against and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature
is not taken into account it is excluded its not supposed to exist!
They dont recognise that humanity developing by a historical living
process will become at last a normal society but they believe that a
social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going
to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an
instant quicker than any living process! Thats why they instinctively
dislike history nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it and they
explain it all as stupidity! Thats why they so dislike the _living_
process of life; they dont want a _living soul_! The living soul
demands life the soul wont obey the rules of mechanics the soul is an
object of suspicion the soul is retrograde! But what they want though
it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber at least is not
alive has no will is servile and wont revolt! And it comes in the end
to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning
of rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready
indeed but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it
wants life it hasnt completed its vital process its too soon for the
graveyard! You cant skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three
possibilities but there are millions! Cut away a million and reduce
it all to the question of comfort! Thats the easiest solution of the
problem! Its seductively clear and you musnt think about it. Thats
the great thing you mustnt think! The whole secret of life in two
pages of print!

Now he is off beating the drum! Catch hold of him do! laughed
Porfiry. Can you imagine he turned to Raskolnikov six people
holding forth like that last night in one room with punch as a
preliminary! No brother you are wrong environment accounts for a
great deal in crime; I can assure you of that.

Oh I know it does but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child
of ten; was it environment drove him to it?

Well strictly speaking it did Porfiry observed with noteworthy
gravity; a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the
influence of environment.

Razumihin was almost in a frenzy. Oh if you like he roared. Ill
prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the
Church of Ivan the Greats being two hundred and fifty feet high and I
will prove it clearly exactly progressively and even with a Liberal
tendency! I undertake to! Will you bet on it?

Done! Lets hear please how he will prove it!

He is always humbugging confound him cried Razumihin jumping up and
gesticulating. Whats the use of talking to you? He does all that
on purpose; you dont know him Rodion! He took their side yesterday
simply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they
were delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he
persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two
months. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going
to get married that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered
new clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no
bride nothing all pure fantasy!

Ah you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the new clothes in
fact that made me think of taking you in.

Are you such a good dissembler? Raskolnikov asked carelessly.

You wouldnt have supposed it eh? Wait a bit I shall take you in
too. Ha-ha-ha! No Ill tell you the truth. All these questions about
crime environment children recall to my mind an article of yours
which interested me at the time. On Crime... or something of the
sort I forget the title I read it with pleasure two months ago in the
_Periodical Review_.

My article? In the _Periodical Review_? Raskolnikov asked in
astonishment. I certainly did write an article upon a book six months
ago when I left the university but I sent it to the _Weekly Review_.

But it came out in the _Periodical_.

And the _Weekly Review_ ceased to exist so thats why it wasnt
printed at the time.

Thats true; but when it ceased to exist the _Weekly Review_ was
amalgamated with the _Periodical_ and so your article appeared two
months ago in the latter. Didnt you know?

Raskolnikov had not known.

Why you might get some money out of them for the article! What a
strange person you are! You lead such a solitary life that you know
nothing of matters that concern you directly. Its a fact I assure
you.

Bravo Rodya! I knew nothing about it either! cried Razumihin. Ill
run to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number. Two months ago?
What was the date? It doesnt matter though I will find it. Think of
not telling us!

How did you find out that the article was mine? Its only signed with
an initial.

I only learnt it by chance the other day. Through the editor; I know
him.... I was very much interested.

I analysed if I remember the psychology of a criminal before and
after the crime.

Yes and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always
accompanied by illness. Very very original but... it was not that part
of your article that interested me so much but an idea at the end of
the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working
it out clearly. There is if you recollect a suggestion that there are
certain persons who can... that is not precisely are able to but have
a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes and that the
law is not for them.

Raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his
idea.

What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the
influence of environment? Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.

No not exactly because of it answered Porfiry. In his article all
men are divided into ordinary and extraordinary. Ordinary men have
to live in submission have no right to transgress the law because
dont you see they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to
commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way just because they
are extraordinary. That was your idea if I am not mistaken?

What do you mean? That cant be right? Razumihin muttered in
bewilderment.

Raskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once and knew where they
wanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.

That wasnt quite my contention he began simply and modestly. Yet
I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps if you like
perfectly so. (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) The only
difference is that I dont contend that extraordinary people are always
bound to commit breaches of morals as you call it. In fact I doubt
whether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an
extraordinary man has the right... that is not an official right but
an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain
obstacles and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment
of his idea (sometimes perhaps of benefit to the whole of humanity).
You say that my article isnt definite; I am ready to make it as clear
as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I
maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have
been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one a dozen a
hundred or more men Newton would have had the right would indeed have
been in duty-bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for
the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But
it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people
right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then I remember I
maintain in my article that all... well legislators and leaders of men
such as Lycurgus Solon Mahomet Napoleon and so on were all without
exception criminals from the very fact that making a new law they
transgressed the ancient one handed down from their ancestors and held
sacred by the people and they did not stop short at bloodshed either
if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence
of ancient law--were of use to their cause. Its remarkable in fact
that the majority indeed of these benefactors and leaders of humanity
were guilty of terrible carnage. In short I maintain that all great men
or even men a little out of the common that is to say capable of giving
some new word must from their very nature be criminals--more or less
of course. Otherwise its hard for them to get out of the common rut;
and to remain in the common rut is what they cant submit to from their
very nature again and to my mind they ought not indeed to submit to
it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The
same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my
division of people into ordinary and extraordinary I acknowledge that
its somewhat arbitrary but I dont insist upon exact numbers. I only
believe in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law
of nature into two categories inferior (ordinary) that is so to say
material that serves only to reproduce its kind and men who have
the gift or the talent to utter _a new word_. There are of course
innumerable sub-divisions but the distinguishing features of both
categories are fairly well marked. The first category generally
speaking are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live
under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty
to be controlled because thats their vocation and there is nothing
humiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the
law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their
capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;
for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the
present for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the
sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood he can I
maintain find within himself in his conscience a sanction for wading
through blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions note that.
Its only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article
(you remember it began with the legal question). Theres no need for
such anxiety however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right
they punish them or hang them (more or less) and in doing so fulfil
quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these
criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or
less). The first category is always the man of the present the second
the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it the
second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal
right to exist. In fact all have equal rights with me--and _vive la
guerre ternelle_--till the New Jerusalem of course!

Then you believe in the New Jerusalem do you?

I do Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during
the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.

And... and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity.

I do repeated Raskolnikov raising his eyes to Porfiry.

And... do you believe in Lazarus rising from the dead?

I... I do. Why do you ask all this?

You believe it literally?

Literally.

You dont say so.... I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. But let us
go back to the question; they are not always executed. Some on the
contrary...

Triumph in their lifetime? Oh yes some attain their ends in this
life and then...

They begin executing other people?

If its necessary; indeed for the most part they do. Your remark is
very witty.

Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary
people from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel
there ought to be more exactitude more external definition. Excuse the
natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen but couldnt they
adopt a special uniform for instance couldnt they wear something be
branded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of
one category imagines that he belongs to the other begins to eliminate
obstacles as you so happily expressed it then...

Oh that very often happens! That remark is wittier than the other.

Thank you.

No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in
the first category that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps
unfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition to
obedience very many of them through a playfulness of nature sometimes
vouchsafed even to the cow like to imagine themselves advanced people
destroyers and to push themselves into the new movement and
this quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often
unobserved by them or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling
tendencies. But I dont think there is any considerable danger here
and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course
they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away
with them and to teach them their place but no more; in fact even
this isnt necessary as they castigate themselves for they are very
conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others
chastise themselves with their own hands.... They will impose various
public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying
effect; in fact youve nothing to be uneasy about.... Its a law of
nature.

Well you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but
theres another thing worries me. Tell me please are there many people
who have the right to kill others these extraordinary people? I am
ready to bow down to them of course but you must admit its alarming
if there are a great many of them eh?

Oh you neednt worry about that either Raskolnikov went on in the
same tone. People with new ideas people with the faintest capacity for
saying something _new_ are extremely few in number extraordinarily
so in fact. One thing only is clear that the appearance of all these
grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity
some law of nature. That law of course is unknown at present but I am
convinced that it exists and one day may become known. The vast mass of
mankind is mere material and only exists in order by some great effort
by some mysterious process by means of some crossing of races and
stocks to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a
thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps--I
speak roughly approximately--is born with some independence and with
still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius
is one of millions and the great geniuses the crown of humanity
appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have
not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there
certainly is and must be a definite law it cannot be a matter of
chance.

Why are you both joking? Razumihin cried at last. There you sit
making fun of one another. Are you serious Rodya?

Raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.
And the unconcealed persistent nervous and _discourteous_ sarcasm of
Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.

Well brother if you are really serious... You are right of course
in saying that its not new that its like what weve read and heard a
thousand times already; but what is really original in all this and is
exclusively your own to my horror is that you sanction bloodshed
_in the name of conscience_ and excuse my saying so with such
fanaticism.... That I take it is the point of your article. But that
sanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind... more terrible
than the official legal sanction of bloodshed....

You are quite right it is more terrible Porfiry agreed.

Yes you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake I shall read it.
You cant think that! I shall read it.

All that is not in the article theres only a hint of it said
Raskolnikov.

Yes yes. Porfiry couldnt sit still. Your attitude to crime is
pretty clear to me now but... excuse me for my impertinence (I am
really ashamed to be worrying you like this) you see youve removed
my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed but... there are various
practical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth
imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and
suppose he begins to remove all obstacles.... He has some great
enterprise before him and needs money for it... and tries to get it...
do you see?

Zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner. Raskolnikov did not even
raise his eyes to him.

I must admit he went on calmly that such cases certainly must
arise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that
snare; young people especially.

Yes you see. Well then?

What then? Raskolnikov smiled in reply; thats not my fault. So it is
and so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)
that I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons
banishment criminal investigators penal servitude. Theres no need to
be uneasy. You have but to catch the thief.

And what if we do catch him?

Then he gets what he deserves.

You are certainly logical. But what of his conscience?

Why do you care about that?

Simply from humanity.

If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his
punishment--as well as the prison.

But the real geniuses asked Razumihin frowning those who have
the right to murder? Oughtnt they to suffer at all even for the blood
theyve shed?

Why the word _ought_? Its not a matter of permission or prohibition.
He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain and suffering are
always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The
really great men must I think have great sadness on earth he added
dreamily not in the tone of the conversation.

He raised his eyes looked earnestly at them all smiled and took his
cap. He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance and
he felt this. Everyone got up.

Well you may abuse me be angry with me if you like Porfiry
Petrovitch began again but I cant resist. Allow me one little
question (I know I am troubling you). There is just one little notion I
want to express simply that I may not forget it.

Very good tell me your little notion Raskolnikov stood waiting pale
and grave before him.

Well you see... I really dont know how to express it properly....
Its a playful psychological idea.... When you were writing your
article surely you couldnt have helped he-he! fancying yourself...
just a little an extraordinary man uttering a _new word_ in your
sense.... Thats so isnt it?

Quite possibly Raskolnikov answered contemptuously.

Razumihin made a movement.

And if so could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties
and hardship or for some service to humanity--to overstep obstacles?...
For instance to rob and murder?

And again he winked with his left eye and laughed noiselessly just as
before.

If I did I certainly should not tell you Raskolnikov answered with
defiant and haughty contempt.

No I was only interested on account of your article from a literary
point of view...

Foo! how obvious and insolent that is! Raskolnikov thought with
repulsion.

Allow me to observe he answered dryly that I dont consider myself
a Mahomet or a Napoleon nor any personage of that kind and not being
one of them I cannot tell you how I should act.

Oh come dont we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?
 Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.

Something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.

Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona
Ivanovna last week? Zametov blurted out from the corner.

Raskolnikov did not speak but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry.
Razumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed before this to be noticing
something. He looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy
silence. Raskolnikov turned to go.

Are you going already? Porfiry said amiably holding out his hand with
excessive politeness. Very very glad of your acquaintance. As for your
request have no uneasiness write just as I told you or better still
come to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow indeed. I shall
be there at eleven oclock for certain. Well arrange it all; well have
a talk. As one of the last to be _there_ you might perhaps be able to
tell us something he added with a most good-natured expression.

You want to cross-examine me officially in due form? Raskolnikov asked
sharply.

Oh why? Thats not necessary for the present. You misunderstand me.
I lose no opportunity you see and... Ive talked with all who had
pledges.... I obtained evidence from some of them and you are the
last.... Yes by the way he cried seemingly suddenly delighted I
just remember what was I thinking of? he turned to Razumihin you
were talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course I know I know
very well he turned to Raskolnikov that the fellow is innocent but
what is one to do? We had to trouble Dmitri too.... This is the point
this is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven wasnt it?

Yes answered Raskolnikov with an unpleasant sensation at the very
moment he spoke that he need not have said it.

Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight didnt you see in
a flat that stood open on a second storey do you remember? two workmen
or at least one of them? They were painting there didnt you notice
them? Its very very important for them.

Painters? No I didnt see them Raskolnikov answered slowly as
though ransacking his memory while at the same instant he was racking
every nerve almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as
possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. No I didnt
see them and I dont think I noticed a flat like that open.... But on
the fourth storey (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant)
I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona
Ivanovnas.... I remember... I remember it clearly. Some porters
were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. But
painters... no I dont remember that there were any painters and I
dont think that there was a flat open anywhere no there wasnt.

What do you mean? Razumihin shouted suddenly as though he had
reflected and realised. Why it was on the day of the murder the
painters were at work and he was there three days before? What are you
asking?

Foo! I have muddled it! Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead.
Deuce take it! This business is turning my brain! he addressed
Raskolnikov somewhat apologetically. It would be such a great thing for
us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at
the flat so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something.... I
quite muddled it.

Then you should be more careful Razumihin observed grimly.

The last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw them
to the door with excessive politeness.

They went out into the street gloomy and sullen and for some steps they
did not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.



CHAPTER VI

I dont believe it I cant believe it! repeated Razumihin trying in
perplexity to refute Raskolnikovs arguments.

They were by now approaching Bakaleyevs lodgings where Pulcheria
Alexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while. Razumihin
kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion confused and excited
by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about
_it_.

Dont believe it then! answered Raskolnikov with a cold careless
smile. You were noticing nothing as usual but I was weighing every
word.

You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their words... hm...
certainly I agree Porfirys tone was rather strange and still
more that wretch Zametov!... You are right there was something about
him--but why? Why?

He has changed his mind since last night.

Quite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea they would do
their utmost to hide it and conceal their cards so as to catch you
afterwards.... But it was all impudent and careless.

If they had had facts--I mean real facts--or at least grounds for
suspicion then they would certainly have tried to hide their game
in the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago
besides). But they have no facts not one. It is all mirage--all
ambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to throw me out by
impudence. And perhaps he was irritated at having no facts and blurted
it out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an
intelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to
know. They have a psychology of their own brother. But it is loathsome
explaining it all. Stop!

And its insulting insulting! I understand you. But... since we have
spoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--I
am glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago
this idea. Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an
insinuation even? How dare they? What foundation have they? If only you
knew how furious I have been. Think only! Simply because a poor student
unhinged by poverty and hypochondria on the eve of a severe delirious
illness (note that) suspicious vain proud who has not seen a soul to
speak to for six months in rags and in boots without soles has to
face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and
the unexpected debt thrust under his nose the I.O.U. presented
by Tchebarov the new paint thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling
atmosphere a crowd of people the talk about the murder of a person
where he had been just before and all that on an empty stomach--he
might well have a fainting fit! And that that is what they found it
all on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is but in your place
Rodya I would laugh at them or better still spit in their ugly faces
and spit a dozen times in all directions. Id hit out in all
directions neatly too and so Id put an end to it. Damn them! Dont be
downhearted. Its a shame!

He really has put it well though Raskolnikov thought.

Damn them? But the cross-examination again to-morrow? he said with
bitterness. Must I really enter into explanations with them? I feel
vexed as it is that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the
restaurant....

Damn it! I will go myself to Porfiry. I will squeeze it out of him as
one of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all! And
as for Zametov...

At last he sees through him! thought Raskolnikov.

Stay! cried Razumihin seizing him by the shoulder again. Stay! you
were wrong. I have thought it out. You are wrong! How was that a trap?
You say that the question about the workmen was a trap. But if you had
done _that_ could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...
and the workmen? On the contrary you would have seen nothing even if
you had seen it. Who would own it against himself?

If I had done _that thing_ I should certainly have said that I had
seen the workmen and the flat Raskolnikov answered with reluctance
and obvious disgust.

But why speak against yourself?

Because only peasants or the most inexperienced novices deny
everything flatly at examinations. If a man is ever so little developed
and experienced he will certainly try to admit all the external facts
that cant be avoided but will seek other explanations of them will
introduce some special unexpected turn that will give them another
significance and put them in another light. Porfiry might well reckon
that I should be sure to answer so and say I had seen them to give an
air of truth and then make some explanation.

But he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been
there two days before and that therefore you must have been there on
the day of the murder at eight oclock. And so he would have caught you
over a detail.

Yes that is what he was reckoning on that I should not have time to
reflect and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer and
so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days
before.

But how could you forget it?

Nothing easier. It is in just such stupid things clever people are most
easily caught. The more cunning a man is the less he suspects that he
will be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is the simpler
the trap he must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you
think....

He is a knave then if that is so!

Raskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the very moment he was
struck by the strangeness of his own frankness and the eagerness
with which he had made this explanation though he had kept up all the
preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion obviously with a motive
from necessity.

I am getting a relish for certain aspects! he thought to himself.
But almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy as though an
unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him. His uneasiness kept on
increasing. They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyevs.

Go in alone! said Raskolnikov suddenly. I will be back directly.

Where are you going? Why we are just here.

I cant help it.... I will come in half an hour. Tell them.

Say what you like I will come with you.

You too want to torture me! he screamed with such bitter
irritation such despair in his eyes that Razumihins hands dropped.
He stood for some time on the steps looking gloomily at Raskolnikov
striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging. At last gritting
his teeth and clenching his fist he swore he would squeeze Porfiry
like a lemon that very day and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria
Alexandrovna who was by now alarmed at their long absence.

When Raskolnikov got home his hair was soaked with sweat and he was
breathing heavily. He went rapidly up the stairs walked into his
unlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Then in senseless terror
he rushed to the corner to that hole under the paper where he had put
the things; put his hand in and for some minutes felt carefully in the
hole in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing he got up
and drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyevs he
suddenly fancied that something a chain a stud or even a bit of paper
in which they had been wrapped with the old womans handwriting on it
might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack and then
might suddenly turn up as unexpected conclusive evidence against him.

He stood as though lost in thought and a strange humiliated half
senseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his cap at last and went
quietly out of the room. His ideas were all tangled. He went dreamily
through the gateway.

Here he is himself shouted a loud voice.

He raised his head.

The porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing
him out to a short man who looked like an artisan wearing a long coat
and a waistcoat and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. He
stooped and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled
flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and
they looked out grimly sternly and discontentedly.

What is it? Raskolnikov asked going up to the porter.

The man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him
attentively deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the
gate into the street without saying a word.

What is it? cried Raskolnikov.

Why he there was asking whether a student lived here mentioned your
name and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out and
he went away. Its funny.

The porter too seemed rather puzzled but not much so and after
wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.

Raskolnikov ran after the stranger and at once caught sight of
him walking along the other side of the street with the same even
deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground as though in
meditation. He soon overtook him but for some time walked behind him.
At last moving on to a level with him he looked at his face. The man
noticed him at once looked at him quickly but dropped his eyes again;
and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.

You were inquiring for me... of the porter? Raskolnikov said at last
but in a curiously quiet voice.

The man made no answer; he didnt even look at him. Again they were both
silent.

Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... Whats the
meaning of it?

Raskolnikovs voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words
clearly.

The man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at
Raskolnikov.

Murderer! he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.

Raskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak a
cold shiver ran down his spine and his heart seemed to stand still for
a moment then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So
they walked for about a hundred paces side by side in silence.

The man did not look at him.

What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer? muttered
Raskolnikov hardly audibly.

_You_ are a murderer the man answered still more articulately and
emphatically with a smile of triumphant hatred and again he looked
straight into Raskolnikovs pale face and stricken eyes.

They had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left
without looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing gazing after
him. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still
standing there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly but he fancied that
he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.

With slow faltering steps with shaking knees Raskolnikov made his way
back to his little garret feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap
and put it on the table and for ten minutes he stood without moving.
Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he
stretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.

He thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts some
images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of
people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once whom he would
never have recalled the belfry of the church at V. the billiard table
in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards the smell of cigars
in some underground tobacco shop a tavern room a back staircase quite
dark all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells and the
Sunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one
another whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried
to clutch at but they faded and all the while there was an oppression
within him but it was not overwhelming sometimes it was even
pleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted but that too
was an almost pleasant sensation.

He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and
pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some
time in the doorway as though hesitating then he stepped softly into
the room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasyas
whisper:

Dont disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later.

Quite so answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the
door. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes turned on
his back again clasping his hands behind his head.

Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he
what did he see? He has seen it all thats clear. Where was he then?
And from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?
And how could he see? Is it possible? Hm... continued Raskolnikov
turning cold and shivering and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the
door--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you
can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is it
possible? He felt with sudden loathing how weak how physically weak he
had become. I ought to have known it he thought with a bitter smile.
And how dared I knowing myself knowing how I should be take up an
axe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah but I did
know! he whispered in despair. At times he came to a standstill at some
thought.

No those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all is
permitted storms Toulon makes a massacre in Paris _forgets_ an army in
Egypt _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off
with a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death and
so _all_ is permitted. No such people it seems are not of flesh but
of bronze!

One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon the
pyramids Waterloo and a wretched skinny old woman a pawnbroker with
a red trunk under her bed--its a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to
digest! How can they digest it! Its too inartistic. A Napoleon creep
under an old womans bed! Ugh how loathsome!

At moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverish
excitement. The old woman is of no consequence he thought hotly and
incoherently. The old woman was a mistake perhaps but she is not
what matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to
overstep.... I didnt kill a human being but a principle! I killed the
principle but I didnt overstep I stopped on this side.... I was
only capable of killing. And it seems I wasnt even capable of that...
Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They are
industrious commercial people; the happiness of all is their case.
No life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I
dont want to wait for the happiness of all. I want to live myself
or else better not live at all. I simply couldnt pass by my mother
starving keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the
happiness of all. I am putting my little brick into the happiness of
all and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only
live once I too want.... Ech I am an sthetic louse and nothing
more he added suddenly laughing like a madman. Yes I am certainly a
louse he went on clutching at the idea gloating over it and playing
with it with vindictive pleasure. In the first place because I can
reason that I am one and secondly because for a month past I have been
troubling benevolent Providence calling it to witness that not for
my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it but with a grand and noble
object--ha-ha! Thirdly because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as
possible weighing measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked
out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I
needed for the first step no more nor less (so the rest would have gone
to a monastery according to her will ha-ha!). And what shows that I
am utterly a louse he added grinding his teeth is that I am
perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed and _I felt
beforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her. Can
anything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! The
abjectness! I understand the prophet with his sabre on his steed:
Allah commands and trembling creation must obey! The prophet is
right he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up
the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! Its for you to
obey trembling creation and not _to have desires_ for thats not for
you!... I shall never never forgive the old woman!

His hair was soaked with sweat his quivering lips were parched his
eyes were fixed on the ceiling.

Mother sister--how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes I hate
them I feel a physical hatred for them I cant bear them near me....
I went up to my mother and kissed her I remember.... To embrace her
and think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? Thats just what
I might do.... _She_ must be the same as I am he added straining
himself to think as it were struggling with delirium. Ah how I hate
the old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!
Poor Lizaveta! Why did she come in?... Its strange though why is it
I scarcely ever think of her as though I hadnt killed her? Lizaveta!
Sonia! Poor gentle things with gentle eyes.... Dear women! Why dont
they weep? Why dont they moan? They give up everything... their eyes
are soft and gentle.... Sonia Sonia! Gentle Sonia!

He lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didnt remember
how he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallen
and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a
peculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the
street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other
people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar dust and
stagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along mournful and anxious; he was
distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose of having to do
something in a hurry but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he
stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street
beckoning to him. He crossed over to him but at once the man turned and
walked away with his head hanging as though he had made no sign to
him. Stay did he really beckon? Raskolnikov wondered but he tried
to overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and
was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long
coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;
they went down a turning; the man still did not look round. Does he
know I am following him? thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the
gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in
to see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard
the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at
once followed him into the yard but the man was gone. He must have
gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard
slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely
familiar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone
through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he
reached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were
at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps
of the man above had died away. So he must have stopped or hidden
somewhere. He reached the third storey should he go on? There was a
stillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own
footsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be
hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open he
hesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage as
though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour
which was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before the
chairs the looking-glass the yellow sofa and the pictures in the
frames. A huge round copper-red moon looked in at the windows.
Its the moon that makes it so still weaving some mystery thought
Raskolnikov. He stood and waited waited a long while and the more
silent the moonlight the more violently his heart beat till it was
painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp
crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly
flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At
that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little
cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. Why is that cloak
here? he thought it wasnt there before.... He went up to it quietly
and felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved
the cloak and saw sitting on a chair in the corner the old woman bent
double so that he couldnt see her face; but it was she. He stood over
her. She is afraid he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the
noose and struck her one blow then another on the skull. But strange
to say she did not stir as though she were made of wood. He was
frightened bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she too
bent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up
into her face from below he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old
woman was sitting and laughing shaking with noiseless laughter doing
her utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door
from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and
whispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the
old woman on the head with all his force but at every blow of the axe
the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old
woman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away but the
passage was full of people the doors of the flats stood open and on the
landing on the stairs and everywhere below there were people rows of
heads all looking but huddled together in silence and expectation.
Something gripped his heart his legs were rooted to the spot they
would not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.

He drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:
his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the
doorway watching him intently.

Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them
again. He lay on his back without stirring.

Is it still a dream? he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly
perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place still watching
him.

He stepped cautiously into the room carefully closing the door after
him went up to the table paused a moment still keeping his eyes on
Raskolnikov and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he
put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane
and his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait
indefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen
glances he was a man no longer young stout with a full fair almost
whitish beard.

Ten minutes passed. It was still light but beginning to get dusk. There
was complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.
Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was
unbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.

Come tell me what you want.

I knew you were not asleep but only pretending the stranger answered
oddly laughing calmly. Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigalov allow me to
introduce myself....




PART IV



CHAPTER I

Can this be still a dream? Raskolnikov thought once more.

He looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor.

Svidrigalov! What nonsense! It cant be! he said at last aloud in
bewilderment.

His visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation.

Ive come to you for two reasons. In the first place I wanted to make
your personal acquaintance as I have already heard a great deal about
you that is interesting and flattering; secondly I cherish the hope
that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the
welfare of your sister Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support she
might not let me come near her now for she is prejudiced against me
but with your assistance I reckon on...

You reckon wrongly interrupted Raskolnikov.

They only arrived yesterday may I ask you?

Raskolnikov made no reply.

It was yesterday I know. I only arrived myself the day before. Well
let me tell you this Rodion Romanovitch I dont consider it necessary
to justify myself but kindly tell me what was there particularly
criminal on my part in all this business speaking without prejudice
with common sense?

Raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.

That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and insulted her
with my infamous proposals--is that it? (I am anticipating you.) But
youve only to assume that I too am a man _et nihil humanum_... in a
word that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love (which
does not depend on our will) then everything can be explained in the
most natural manner. The question is am I a monster or am I myself
a victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing to the object of my
passion to elope with me to America or Switzerland I may have cherished
the deepest respect for her and may have thought that I was promoting
our mutual happiness! Reason is the slave of passion you know; why
probably I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!

But thats not the point Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. Its
simply that whether you are right or wrong we dislike you. We dont
want to have anything to do with you. We show you the door. Go out!

Svidrigalov broke into a sudden laugh.

But youre... but theres no getting round you he said laughing in
the frankest way. I hoped to get round you but you took up the right
line at once!

But you are trying to get round me still!

What of it? What of it? cried Svidrigalov laughing openly. But this
is what the French call _bonne guerre_ and the most innocent form of
deception!... But still you have interrupted me; one way or another I
repeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for
what happened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna...

You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna too so they say? Raskolnikov
interrupted rudely.

Oh youve heard that too then? Youd be sure to though.... But
as for your question I really dont know what to say though my own
conscience is quite at rest on that score. Dont suppose that I am in
any apprehension about it. All was regular and in order; the medical
inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy
dinner and a bottle of wine and indeed it could have proved nothing
else. But Ill tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late on
my way here in the train especially: didnt I contribute to all that...
calamity morally in a way by irritation or something of the
sort. But I came to the conclusion that that too was quite out of the
question.

Raskolnikov laughed.

I wonder you trouble yourself about it!

But what are you laughing at? Only consider I struck her just twice
with a switch--there were no marks even... dont regard me as a cynic
please; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that;
but I know for certain too that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased
at my so to say warmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out to
the last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to
sit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town. Besides
she had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the
letter). And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven! Her
first act was to order the carriage to be got out.... Not to speak
of the fact that there are cases when women are very very glad to be
insulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There are instances
of it with everyone; human beings in general indeed greatly love to
be insulted have you noticed that? But its particularly so with women.
One might even say its their only amusement.

At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so
finishing the interview. But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence
made him linger for a moment.

You are fond of fighting? he asked carelessly.

No not very Svidrigalov answered calmly. And Marfa Petrovna and
I scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmoniously and she was always
pleased with me. I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not
counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character). The first
time two months after our marriage immediately after we arrived in the
country and the last time was that of which we are speaking. Did you
suppose I was such a monster such a reactionary such a slave driver?
Ha ha! By the way do you remember Rodion Romanovitch how a few years
ago in those days of beneficent publicity a nobleman Ive forgotten
his name was put to shame everywhere in all the papers for having
thrashed a German woman in the railway train. You remember? It was in
those days that very year I believe the disgraceful action of the
_Age_ took place (you know The Egyptian Nights that public reading
you remember? The dark eyes you know! Ah the golden days of our youth
where are they?). Well as for the gentleman who thrashed the German
I feel no sympathy with him because after all what need is there
for sympathy? But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking
Germans that I dont believe there is a progressive who could quite
answer for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of view
then but thats the truly humane point of view I assure you.

After saying this Svidrigalov broke into a sudden laugh again.
Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his
mind and able to keep it to himself.

I expect youve not talked to anyone for some days? he asked.

Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my being such an
adaptable man?

No I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man.

Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions? Is that
it? But why take offence? As you asked so I answered he replied
with a surprising expression of simplicity. You know theres
hardly anything I take interest in he went on as it were dreamily
especially now Ive nothing to do.... You are quite at liberty to
imagine though that I am making up to you with a motive particularly as
I told you I want to see your sister about something. But Ill confess
frankly I am very much bored. The last three days especially so I am
delighted to see you.... Dont be angry Rodion Romanovitch but you
seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself. Say what you like theres
something wrong with you and now too... not this very minute I mean
but now generally.... Well well I wont I wont dont scowl! I am
not such a bear you know as you think.

Raskolnikov looked gloomily at him.

You are not a bear perhaps at all he said. I fancy indeed that
you are a man of very good breeding or at least know how on occasion to
behave like one.

I am not particularly interested in anyones opinion Svidrigalov
answered dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness and therefore why
not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our
climate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way he
added laughing again.

But Ive heard you have many friends here. You are as they say not
without connections. What can you want with me then unless youve
some special object?

Thats true that I have friends here Svidrigalov admitted not
replying to the chief point. Ive met some already. Ive been lounging
about for the last three days and Ive seen them or theyve seen me.
Thats a matter of course. I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor
man; the emancipation of the serfs hasnt affected me; my property
consists chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not
fallen off; but... I am not going to see them I was sick of them long
ago. Ive been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town
it is! How has it come into existence among us tell me that? A town of
officials and students of all sorts. Yes theres a great deal I didnt
notice when I was here eight years ago kicking up my heels.... My only
hope now is in anatomy by Jove it is!

Anatomy?

But as for these clubs Dussauts parades or progress indeed
maybe--well all that can go on without me he went on again without
noticing the question. Besides who wants to be a card-sharper?

Why have you been a card-sharper then?

How could I help being? There was a regular set of us men of the best
society eight years ago; we had a fine time. And all men of breeding
you know poets men of property. And indeed as a rule in our Russian
society the best manners are found among those whove been thrashed
have you noticed that? Ive deteriorated in the country. But I did get
into prison for debt through a low Greek who came from Nezhin. Then
Marfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off for
thirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand). We were united
in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure.
You know she was five years older than I. She was very fond of me. For
seven years I never left the country. And take note that all my life
she held a document over me the IOU for thirty thousand roubles so
if I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at
once! And she would have done it! Women find nothing incompatible in
that.

If it hadnt been for that would you have given her the slip?

I dont know what to say. It was scarcely the document restrained me. I
didnt want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go
abroad seeing I was bored but Ive been abroad before and always
felt sick there. For no reason but the sunrise the bay of Naples the
sea--you look at them and it makes you sad. Whats most revolting is
that one is really sad! No its better at home. Here at least one
blames others for everything and excuses oneself. I should have gone
perhaps on an expedition to the North Pole because _jai le vin
mauvais_ and hate drinking and theres nothing left but wine. I have
tried it. But I say Ive been told Berg is going up in a great balloon
next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a
fee. Is it true?

Why would you go up?

I... No oh no muttered Svidrigalov really seeming to be deep in
thought.

What does he mean? Is he in earnest? Raskolnikov wondered.

No the document didnt restrain me Svidrigalov went on
meditatively. It was my own doing not leaving the country and nearly
a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day
and made me a present of a considerable sum of money too. She had a
fortune you know. You see how I trust you Arkady Ivanovitch--that
was actually her expression. You dont believe she used it? But do
you know I managed the estate quite decently they know me in the
neighbourhood. I ordered books too. Marfa Petrovna at first approved
but afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying.

You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?

Missing her? Perhaps. Really perhaps I am. And by the way do you
believe in ghosts?

What ghosts?

Why ordinary ghosts.

Do you believe in them?

Perhaps not _pour vous plaire_.... I wouldnt say no exactly.

Do you see them then?

Svidrigalov looked at him rather oddly.

Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me he said twisting his mouth
into a strange smile.

How do you mean she is pleased to visit you?

She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day of the
funeral an hour after she was buried. It was the day before I left to
come here. The second time was the day before yesterday at daybreak on
the journey at the station of Malaya Vishera and the third time was two
hours ago in the room where I am staying. I was alone.

Were you awake?

Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes speaks to me for
a minute and goes out at the door--always at the door. I can almost hear
her.

What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to
you? Raskolnikov said suddenly.

At the same moment he was surprised at having said it. He was much
excited.

What! Did you think so? Svidrigalov asked in astonishment. Did you
really? Didnt I say that there was something in common between us eh?

You never said so! Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat.

Didnt I?

No!

I thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut
pretending I said to myself at once Heres the man.

What do you mean by the man? What are you talking about? cried
Raskolnikov.

What do I mean? I really dont know.... Svidrigalov muttered
ingenuously as though he too were puzzled.

For a minute they were silent. They stared in each others faces.

Thats all nonsense! Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. What does she
say when she comes to you?

She! Would you believe it she talks of the silliest trifles and--man
is a strange creature--it makes me angry. The first time she came in (I
was tired you know: the funeral service the funeral ceremony the lunch
afterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and
began to think) she came in at the door. Youve been so busy to-day
Arkady Ivanovitch you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock
she said. All those seven years Ive wound that clock every week and if
I forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my way
here. I got out at the station at daybreak; Id been asleep tired out
with my eyes half open I was drinking some coffee. I looked up and
there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of
cards in her hands. Shall I tell your fortune for the journey Arkady
Ivanovitch? She was a great hand at telling fortunes. I shall never
forgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright and
besides the bell rang. I was sitting to-day feeling very heavy after a
miserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking all of a sudden
Marfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dress
with a long train. Good day Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my
dress? Aniska cant make like this. (Aniska was a dressmaker in the
country one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow a
pretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress
and then I looked carefully very carefully at her face. I wonder
you trouble to come to me about such trifles Marfa Petrovna. Good
gracious you wont let one disturb you about anything! To tease her
I said I want to get married Marfa Petrovna. Thats just like you
Arkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a
bride when youve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a good
choice at least but I know it wont be for your happiness or hers you
will only be a laughing-stock to all good people. Then she went out and
her train seemed to rustle. Isnt it nonsense eh?

But perhaps you are telling lies? Raskolnikov put in.

I rarely lie answered Svidrigalov thoughtfully apparently not
noticing the rudeness of the question.

And in the past have you ever seen ghosts before?

Y-yes I have seen them but only once in my life six years ago. I had
a serf Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting Filka my
pipe! He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were. I sat
still and thought he is doing it out of revenge because we had a
violent quarrel just before his death. How dare you come in with a hole
in your elbow? I said. Go away you scamp! He turned and went out
and never came again. I didnt tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wanted
to have a service sung for him but I was ashamed.

You should go to a doctor.

I know I am not well without your telling me though I dont know
whats wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are. I didnt
ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen but whether you
believe that they exist.

No I wont believe it! Raskolnikov cried with positive anger.

What do people generally say? muttered Svidrigalov as though
speaking to himself looking aside and bowing his head. They say You
are ill so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy. But thats not
strictly logical. I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick but that
only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick not that
they dont exist.

Nothing of the sort Raskolnikov insisted irritably.

No? You dont think so? Svidrigalov went on looking at him
deliberately. But what do you say to this argument (help me with
it): ghosts are as it were shreds and fragments of other worlds the
beginning of them. A man in health has of course no reason to see
them because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the
sake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon
as one is ill as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is
broken one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the
more seriously ill one is the closer becomes ones contact with that
other world so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that
world. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life you
could believe in that too.

I dont believe in a future life said Raskolnikov.

Svidrigalov sat lost in thought.

And what if there are only spiders there or something of that sort
 he said suddenly.

He is a madman thought Raskolnikov.

We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception
something vast vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that what
if its one little room like a bath house in the country black
and grimy and spiders in every corner and thats all eternity is? I
sometimes fancy it like that.

Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than
that? Raskolnikov cried with a feeling of anguish.

Juster? And how can we tell perhaps that is just and do you know
its what I would certainly have made it answered Svidrigalov with a
vague smile.

This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. Svidrigalov
raised his head looked at him and suddenly began laughing.

Only think he cried half an hour ago we had never seen each other
we regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between
us; weve thrown it aside and away weve gone into the abstract! Wasnt
I right in saying that we were birds of a feather?

Kindly allow me Raskolnikov went on irritably to ask you to explain
why you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry
I have no time to waste. I want to go out.

By all means by all means. Your sister Avdotya Romanovna is going to
be married to Mr. Luzhin Pyotr Petrovitch?

Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning
her name? I cant understand how you dare utter her name in my presence
if you really are Svidrigalov.

Why but Ive come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning
her?

Very good speak but make haste.

I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.
Luzhin who is a connection of mine through my wife if you have only
seen him for half an hour or heard any facts about him. He is no
match for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing
herself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of
her family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very
glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly
advantages. Now I know you personally I am convinced of it.

All this is very nave... excuse me I should have said impudent on
your part said Raskolnikov.

You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Dont be uneasy Rodion
Romanovitch if I were working for my own advantage I would not have
spoken out so directly. I am not quite a fool. I will confess something
psychologically curious about that: just now defending my love for
Avdotya Romanovna I said I was myself the victim. Well let me tell you
that Ive no feeling of love now not the slightest so that I wonder
myself indeed for I really did feel something...

Through idleness and depravity Raskolnikov put in.

I certainly am idle and depraved but your sister has such qualities
that even I could not help being impressed by them. But thats all
nonsense as I see myself now.

Have you seen that long?

I began to be aware of it before but was only perfectly sure of it the
day before yesterday almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I
still fancied in Moscow though that I was coming to try to get Avdotya
Romanovnas hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin.

Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief and come to the object
of your visit. I am in a hurry I want to go out...

With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a
certain... journey I should like to make some necessary preliminary
arrangements. I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided
for; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I should
make too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year
ago. Thats enough for me. Excuse me I am just coming to the point.
Before the journey which may come off I want to settle Mr. Luzhin too.
Its not that I detest him so much but it was through him I quarrelled
with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage.
I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation and if you
like in your presence to explain to her that in the first place she
will never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then begging
her pardon for all past unpleasantness to make her a present of ten
thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin a rupture to
which I believe she is herself not disinclined if she could see the way
to it.

You are certainly mad cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as
astonished. How dare you talk like that!

I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place though I am not
rich this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no
need for it. If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it I shall waste
it in some more foolish way. Thats the first thing. Secondly my
conscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive.
You may not believe it but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will
know. The point is that I did actually cause your sister whom I
greatly respect some trouble and unpleasantness and so sincerely
regretting it I want--not to compensate not to repay her for the
unpleasantness but simply to do something to her advantage to show
that I am not after all privileged to do nothing but harm. If there
were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer I should not
have made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand
only when five weeks ago I offered her more Besides I may perhaps
very soon marry a young lady and that alone ought to prevent suspicion
of any design on Avdotya Romanovna. In conclusion let me say that
in marrying Mr. Luzhin she is taking money just the same only from
another man. Dont be angry Rodion Romanovitch think it over coolly
and quietly.

Svidrigalov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying
this.

I beg you to say no more said Raskolnikov. In any case this is
unpardonable impertinence.

Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour
in this world and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good
by trivial conventional formalities. Thats absurd. If I died for
instance and left that sum to your sister in my will surely she
wouldnt refuse it?

Very likely she would.

Oh no indeed. However if you refuse it so be it though ten
thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. In any case I
beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna.

No I wont.

In that case Rodion Romanovitch I shall be obliged to try and see her
myself and worry her by doing so.

And if I do tell her will you not try to see her?

I dont know really what to say. I should like very much to see her
once more.

Dont hope for it.

Im sorry. But you dont know me. Perhaps we may become better
friends.

You think we may become friends?

And why not? Svidrigalov said smiling. He stood up and took his hat.
I didnt quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning
on it... though I was very much struck by your face this morning.

Where did you see me this morning? Raskolnikov asked uneasily.

I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about you
like me.... But dont be uneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get on
all right with card-sharpers and I never bored Prince Svirbey a great
personage who is a distant relation of mine and I could write about
Raphaels _Madonna_ in Madam Prilukovs album and I never left Marfa
Petrovnas side for seven years and I used to stay the night at
Viazemskys house in the Hay Market in the old days and I may go up in
a balloon with Berg perhaps.

Oh all right. Are you starting soon on your travels may I ask?

What travels?

Why on that journey; you spoke of it yourself.

A journey? Oh yes. I did speak of a journey. Well thats a wide
subject.... if only you knew what you are asking he added and gave
a sudden loud short laugh. Perhaps Ill get married instead of the
journey. Theyre making a match for me.

Here?

Yes.

How have you had time for that?

But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. I earnestly beg
it. Well good-bye for the present. Oh yes. I have forgotten something.
Tell your sister Rodion Romanovitch that Marfa Petrovna remembered
her in her will and left her three thousand roubles. Thats absolutely
certain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death and it was
done in my presence. Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money
in two or three weeks.

Are you telling the truth?

Yes tell her. Well your servant. I am staying very near you.

As he went out Svidrigalov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway.



CHAPTER II

It was nearly eight oclock. The two young men hurried to Bakaleyevs
to arrive before Luzhin.

Why who was that? asked Razumihin as soon as they were in the
street.

It was Svidrigalov that landowner in whose house my sister was
insulted when she was their governess. Through his persecuting her with
his attentions she was turned out by his wife Marfa Petrovna. This
Marfa Petrovna begged Dounias forgiveness afterwards and shes just
died suddenly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I dont
know why Im afraid of that man. He came here at once after his wifes
funeral. He is very strange and is determined on doing something.... We
must guard Dounia from him... thats what I wanted to tell you do you
hear?

Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna? Thank you Rodya
for speaking to me like that.... We will we will guard her. Where does
he live?

I dont know.

Why didnt you ask? What a pity! Ill find out though.

Did you see him? asked Raskolnikov after a pause.

Yes I noticed him I noticed him well.

You did really see him? You saw him clearly? Raskolnikov insisted.

Yes I remember him perfectly I should know him in a thousand; I have
a good memory for faces.

They were silent again.

Hm!... thats all right muttered Raskolnikov. Do you know I
fancied... I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination.

What do you mean? I dont understand you.

Well you all say Raskolnikov went on twisting his mouth into a
smile that I am mad. I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad
and have only seen a phantom.

What do you mean?

Why who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad and perhaps everything that
happened all these days may be only imagination.

Ach Rodya you have been upset again!... But what did he say what did
he come for?

Raskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a minute.

Now let me tell you my story he began I came to you you were
asleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfirys Zametov was
still with him. I tried to begin but it was no use. I couldnt speak in
the right way. They dont seem to understand and cant understand but
are not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window and began talking
to him but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At
last I shook my fist in his ugly face and told him as a cousin Id
brain him. He merely looked at me I cursed and came away. That was
all. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didnt say a word. But you see I
thought Id made a mess of it but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea
struck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger
or anything but why need you care? You neednt care a hang for them. We
shall have a laugh at them afterwards and if I were in your place Id
mystify them more than ever. How ashamed theyll be afterwards! Hang
them! We can thrash them afterwards but lets laugh at them now!

To be sure answered Raskolnikov. But what will you say to-morrow?
 he thought to himself. Strange to say till that moment it had never
occurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As he
thought it Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihins account of his visit
to Porfiry had very little interest for him so much had come and gone
since then.

In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually
at eight and was looking for the number so that all three went in
together without greeting or looking at one another. The young men
walked in first while Pyotr Petrovitch for good manners lingered a
little in the passage taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came
forward at once to greet him in the doorway Dounia was welcoming her
brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably though with
redoubled dignity bowed to the ladies. He looked however as though
he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria
Alexandrovna who seemed also a little embarrassed hastened to make
them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia
and Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.
Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna Razumihin
was next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.

A moments silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a
cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of
a benevolent man who felt himself slighted and was firmly resolved to
insist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to
keep on his overcoat and walk away and so give the two ladies a sharp
and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.
But he could not bring himself to do this. Besides he could not endure
uncertainty and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so
openly disobeyed there was something behind it and in that case it was
better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and
there would always be time for that.

I trust you had a favourable journey he inquired officially of
Pulcheria Alexandrovna.

Oh very Pyotr Petrovitch.

I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued
either?

I am young and strong I dont get tired but it was a great strain for
mother answered Dounia.

Thats unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible length.
Mother Russia as they say is a vast country.... In spite of all my
desire to do so I was unable to meet you yesterday. But I trust all
passed off without inconvenience?

Oh no Pyotr Petrovitch it was all terribly disheartening Pulcheria
Alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation and if
Dmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us I really believe by God Himself
we should have been utterly lost. Here he is! Dmitri Prokofitch
Razumihin she added introducing him to Luzhin.

I had the pleasure... yesterday muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a
hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.

Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons on the surface very
polite in society who make a great point of punctiliousness but who
directly they are crossed in anything are completely disconcerted and
become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.
Again all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute Avdotya
Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had
nothing to say so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.

Marfa Petrovna is dead have you heard? she began having recourse to
her leading item of conversation.

To be sure I heard so. I was immediately informed and I have come to
make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigalov
set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wifes funeral. So
at least I have excellent authority for believing.

To Petersburg? here? Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.

Yes indeed and doubtless not without some design having in view the
rapidity of his departure and all the circumstances preceding it.

Good heavens! wont he leave Dounia in peace even here? cried
Pulcheria Alexandrovna.

I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for
uneasiness unless of course you are yourselves desirous of getting
into communication with him. For my part I am on my guard and am now
discovering where he is lodging.

Oh Pyotr Petrovitch you would not believe what a fright you have
given me Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: Ive only seen him twice
but I thought him terrible terrible! I am convinced that he was the
cause of Marfa Petrovnas death.

Its impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I
do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of
events by the moral influence so to say of the affront; but as to the
general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage I am
in agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now and
precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within
a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg if he has any
pecuniary resources he will relapse at once into his old ways. He is
the most depraved and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.
I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna who was so
unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years
ago was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertions
and sacrifices a criminal charge involving an element of fantastic
and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to
Siberia was hushed up. Thats the sort of man he is if you care to
know.

Good heavens! cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov listened
attentively.

Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of
this? Dounia asked sternly and emphatically.

I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must
observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.
There was and I believe still is living here a woman called Resslich
a foreigner who lent small sums of money at interest and did other
commissions and with this woman Svidrigalov had for a long while close
and mysterious relations. She had a relation a niece I believe living
with her a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen or perhaps not more than
fourteen. Resslich hated this girl and grudged her every crust; she
used to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in
the garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usual
proceedings the matter ended but later on information was given that
the child had been... cruelly outraged by Svidrigalov. It is true this
was not clearly established the information was given by another German
woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement
was actually made to the police thanks to Marfa Petrovnas money and
exertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very
significant one. You heard no doubt Avdotya Romanovna when you were
with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he
received six years ago before the abolition of serfdom.

I heard on the contrary that this Philip hanged himself.

Quite so but what drove him or rather perhaps disposed him
to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.
Svidrigalov.

I dont know that answered Dounia dryly. I only heard a queer story
that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac a sort of domestic philosopher
the servants used to say he read himself silly and that he hanged
himself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigalovs mockery of him and not
his blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants and they
were actually fond of him though they certainly did blame him for
Philips death.

I perceive Avdotya Romanovna that you seem disposed to undertake his
defence all of a sudden Luzhin observed twisting his lips into
an ambiguous smile theres no doubt that he is an astute man and
insinuating where ladies are concerned of which Marfa Petrovna who has
died so strangely is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to be
of service to you and your mother with my advice in view of the renewed
efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part its
my firm conviction that he will end in a debtors prison again.
Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything
substantial on him having regard for his childrens interests and
if she left him anything it would only be the merest sufficiency
something insignificant and ephemeral which would not last a year for a
man of his habits.

Pyotr Petrovitch I beg you said Dounia say no more of Mr.
Svidrigalov. It makes me miserable.

He has just been to see me said Raskolnikov breaking his silence for
the first time.

There were exclamations from all and they all turned to him. Even Pyotr
Petrovitch was roused.

An hour and a half ago he came in when I was asleep waked me and
introduced himself Raskolnikov continued. He was fairly cheerful
and at ease and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He is
particularly anxious by the way Dounia for an interview with you at
which he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you and
he told me about it. He told me too that a week before her death Marfa
Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will Dounia and that
you can receive the money very shortly.

Thank God! cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna crossing herself. Pray for
her soul Dounia!

Its a fact! broke from Luzhin.

Tell us what more? Dounia urged Raskolnikov.

Then he said that he wasnt rich and all the estate was left to his
children who are now with an aunt then that he was staying somewhere
not far from me but where I dont know I didnt ask....

But what what does he want to propose to Dounia? cried Pulcheria
Alexandrovna in a fright. Did he tell you?

Yes.

What was it?

Ill tell you afterwards.

Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea.

Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.

I am compelled to keep a business engagement and so I shall not be in
your way he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up.

Dont go Pyotr Petrovitch said Dounia you intended to spend
the evening. Besides you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an
explanation with mother.

Precisely so Avdotya Romanovna Pyotr Petrovitch answered
impressively sitting down again but still holding his hat. I
certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon
a very important point indeed. But as your brother cannot speak openly
in my presence of some proposals of Mr. Svidrigalov I too do not
desire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others...
of certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover my most weighty
and urgent request has been disregarded....

Assuming an aggrieved air Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.

Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was
disregarded solely at my insistance said Dounia. You wrote that you
had been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at
once and you must be reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you
then he _should_ and _will_ apologise.

Pyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.

There are insults Avdotya Romanovna which no goodwill can make us
forget. There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep;
and when it has been overstepped there is no return.

That wasnt what I was speaking of exactly Pyotr Petrovitch Dounia
interrupted with some impatience. Please understand that our whole
future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as
soon as possible. I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at
it in any other light and if you have the least regard for me all this
business must be ended to-day however hard that may be. I repeat that
if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness.

I am surprised at your putting the question like that said Luzhin
getting more and more irritated. Esteeming and so to say adoring you
I may at the same time very well indeed be able to dislike some member
of your family. Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand I
cannot accept duties incompatible with...

Ah dont be so ready to take offence Pyotr Petrovitch Dounia
interrupted with feeling and be the sensible and generous man I have
always considered and wish to consider you to be. Ive given you a
great promise I am your betrothed. Trust me in this matter and believe
me I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of
judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When I insisted
on his coming to our interview to-day after your letter I told
him nothing of what I meant to do. Understand that if you are not
reconciled I must choose between you--it must be either you or he. That
is how the question rests on your side and on his. I dont want to be
mistaken in my choice and I must not be. For your sake I must break off
with my brother for my brothers sake I must break off with you. I can
find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me and I want to
know it; and of you whether I am dear to you whether you esteem me
whether you are the husband for me.

Avdotya Romanovna Luzhin declared huffily your words are of too
much consequence to me; I will say more they are offensive in view
of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you. To say
nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an
impertinent boy you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to
me. You say you or he showing thereby of how little consequence I
am in your eyes... I cannot let this pass considering the relationship
and... the obligations existing between us.

What! cried Dounia flushing. I set your interest beside all that has
hitherto been most precious in my life what has made up the _whole_ of
my life and here you are offended at my making too _little_ account of
you.

Raskolnikov smiled sarcastically Razumihin fidgeted but Pyotr
Petrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary at every word he
became more persistent and irritable as though he relished it.

Love for the future partner of your life for your husband ought to
outweigh your love for your brother he pronounced sententiously and
in any case I cannot be put on the same level.... Although I said so
emphatically that I would not speak openly in your brothers presence
nevertheless I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary
explanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity.
Your son he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna yesterday in the
presence of Mr. Razsudkin (or... I think thats it? excuse me I have
forgotten your surname he bowed politely to Razumihin) insulted me by
misrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation
drinking coffee that is that marriage with a poor girl who has had
experience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of
view than with one who has lived in luxury since it is more profitable
for the moral character. Your son intentionally exaggerated the
significance of my words and made them ridiculous accusing me of
malicious intentions and as far as I could see relied upon your
correspondence with him. I shall consider myself happy Pulcheria
Alexandrovna if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite
conclusion and thereby considerately reassure me. Kindly let me know
in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion
Romanovitch.

I dont remember faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. I repeated them as
I understood them. I dont know how Rodya repeated them to you perhaps
he exaggerated.

He could not have exaggerated them except at your instigation.

Pyotr Petrovitch Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity the
proof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense is
the fact that we are here.

Good mother said Dounia approvingly.

Then this is my fault again said Luzhin aggrieved.

Well Pyotr Petrovitch you keep blaming Rodion but you yourself have
just written what was false about him Pulcheria Alexandrovna added
gaining courage.

I dont remember writing anything false.

You wrote Raskolnikov said sharply not turning to Luzhin that I
gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed as was
the fact but to his daughter (whom I had never seen till yesterday).
You wrote this to make dissension between me and my family and for that
object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you
dont know. All that is mean slander.

Excuse me sir said Luzhin quivering with fury. I enlarged upon
your qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your
sisters and mothers inquiries how I found you and what impression
you made on me. As for what youve alluded to in my letter be so good
as to point out one word of falsehood show that is that you didnt
throw away your money and that there are not worthless persons in that
family however unfortunate.

To my thinking you with all your virtues are not worth the little
finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones.

Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and
sister?

I have done so already if you care to know. I made her sit down to-day
with mother and Dounia.

Rodya! cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia crimsoned Razumihin
knitted his brows. Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm.

You may see for yourself Avdotya Romanovna he said whether it is
possible for us to agree. I hope now that this question is at an end
once and for all. I will withdraw that I may not hinder the pleasures
of family intimacy and the discussion of secrets. He got up from his
chair and took his hat. But in withdrawing I venture to request
that for the future I may be spared similar meetings and so to
say compromises. I appeal particularly to you honoured Pulcheria
Alexandrovna on this subject the more as my letter was addressed to
you and to no one else.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.

You seem to think we are completely under your authority Pyotr
Petrovitch. Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded
she had the best intentions. And indeed you write as though you were
laying commands upon me. Are we to consider every desire of yours as
a command? Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show
particular delicacy and consideration for us now because we have thrown
up everything and have come here relying on you and so we are in any
case in a sense in your hands.

That is not quite true Pulcheria Alexandrovna especially at the
present moment when the news has come of Marfa Petrovnas legacy which
seems indeed very apropos judging from the new tone you take to me he
added sarcastically.

Judging from that remark we may certainly presume that you were
reckoning on our helplessness Dounia observed irritably.

But now in any case I cannot reckon on it and I particularly desire
not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of Arkady
Ivanovitch Svidrigalov which he has entrusted to your brother and
which have I perceive a great and possibly a very agreeable interest
for you.

Good heavens! cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.

Razumihin could not sit still on his chair.

Arent you ashamed now sister? asked Raskolnikov.

I am ashamed Rodya said Dounia. Pyotr Petrovitch go away she
turned to him white with anger.

Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.
He had too much confidence in himself in his power and in the
helplessness of his victims. He could not believe it even now. He turned
pale and his lips quivered.

Avdotya Romanovna if I go out of this door now after such a
dismissal then you may reckon on it I will never come back. Consider
what you are doing. My word is not to be shaken.

What insolence! cried Dounia springing up from her seat. I dont
want you to come back again.

What! So thats how it stands! cried Luzhin utterly unable to the
last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of
his reckoning now. So thats how it stands! But do you know Avdotya
Romanovna that I might protest?

What right have you to speak to her like that? Pulcheria Alexandrovna
intervened hotly. And what can you protest about? What rights have you?
Am I to give my Dounia to a man like you? Go away leave us altogether!
We are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action and I above
all....

But you have bound me Pulcheria Alexandrovna Luzhin stormed in a
frenzy by your promise and now you deny it and... besides... I have
been led on account of that into expenses....

This last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch that
Raskolnikov pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it
could not help breaking into laughter. But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
furious.

Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our trunk? But the
conductor brought it for nothing for you. Mercy on us we have bound
you! What are you thinking about Pyotr Petrovitch it was you bound us
hand and foot not we!

Enough mother no more please Avdotya Romanovna implored. Pyotr
Petrovitch do be kind and go!

I am going but one last word he said quite unable to control
himself. Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my
mind to take you so to speak after the gossip of the town had spread
all over the district in regard to your reputation. Disregarding public
opinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation I certainly
might very well reckon on a fitting return and might indeed look for
gratitude on your part. And my eyes have only now been opened! I see
myself that I may have acted very very recklessly in disregarding the
universal verdict....

Does the fellow want his head smashed? cried Razumihin jumping up.

You are a mean and spiteful man! cried Dounia.

Not a word! Not a movement! cried Raskolnikov holding Razumihin back;
then going close up to Luzhin Kindly leave the room! he said quietly
and distinctly and not a word more or...

Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that
worked with anger then he turned went out and rarely has any man
carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against
Raskolnikov. Him and him alone he blamed for everything. It is
noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case
was perhaps not utterly lost and that so far as the ladies were
concerned all might very well indeed be set right again.



CHAPTER III

The fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an
ending; he had been overbearing to the last degree never dreaming that
two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control. This
conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit a conceit to
the point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch who had made his way up from
insignificance was morbidly given to self-admiration had the highest
opinion of his intelligence and capacities and sometimes even gloated
in solitude over his image in the glass. But what he loved and valued
above all was the money he had amassed by his labour and by all sorts
of devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his
superiors.

When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in
spite of evil report Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity
and had indeed felt genuinely indignant at such black ingratitude.
 And yet when he made Dounia his offer he was fully aware of the
groundlessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere
contradicted by Marfa Petrovna and was by then disbelieved by all the
townspeople who were warm in Douniaa defence. And he would not have
denied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he still thought highly
of his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as
something heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia he had let out the secret
feeling he cherished and admired and he could not understand that
others should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov with
the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good
deeds and to hear agreeable flattery. And as he went downstairs now he
considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.

Dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.
For many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage but he had
gone on waiting and amassing money. He brooded with relish in profound
secret over the image of a girl--virtuous poor (she must be poor)
very young very pretty of good birth and education very timid one
who had suffered much and was completely humbled before him one who
would all her life look on him as her saviour worship him admire him
and only him. How many scenes how many amorous episodes he had imagined
on this seductive and playful theme when his work was over! And
behold the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and
education of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position
had been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he
dreamed of. Here was a girl of pride character virtue of education
and breeding superior to his own (he felt that) and this creature would
be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension and
would humble herself in the dust before him and he would have absolute
unbounded power over her!... Not long before he had too after long
reflection and hesitation made an important change in his career and
was now entering on a wider circle of business. With this change his
cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely
to be realised.... He was in fact determined to try his fortune
in Petersburg. He knew that women could do a very great deal. The
fascination of a charming virtuous highly educated woman might make
his way easier might do wonders in attracting people to him throwing
an aureole round him and now everything was in ruins! This sudden
horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a
hideous joke an absurdity. He had only been a tiny bit masterful
had not even time to speak out had simply made a joke been carried
away--and it had ended so seriously. And of course too he did love
Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and all
at once! No! The next day the very next day it must all be set right
smoothed over settled. Above all he must crush that conceited milksop
who was the cause of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help
recalling Razumihin too but he soon reassured himself on that score;
as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! The man
he really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigalov.... He had in short a
great deal to attend to....

*****

No I I am more to blame than anyone! said Dounia kissing and
embracing her mother. I was tempted by his money but on my honour
brother I had no idea he was such a base man. If I had seen through him
before nothing would have tempted me! Dont blame me brother!

God has delivered us! God has delivered us! Pulcheria Alexandrovna
muttered but half consciously as though scarcely able to realise what
had happened.

They were all relieved and in five minutes they were laughing. Only now
and then Dounia turned white and frowned remembering what had passed.
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she too was glad:
she had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible
misfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare to express his
joy fully but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight
had fallen off his heart. Now he had the right to devote his life to
them to serve them.... Anything might happen now! But he felt afraid to
think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination
range. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place almost sullen and
indifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of
Luzhin he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened. Dounia
could not help thinking that he was still angry with her and Pulcheria
Alexandrovna watched him timidly.

What did Svidrigalov say to you? said Dounia approaching him.

Yes yes! cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.

Raskolnikov raised his head.

He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires
to see you once in my presence.

See her! On no account! cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. And how dare he
offer her money!

Then Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation with
Svidrigalov omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of Marfa
Petrovna wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk.

What answer did you give him? asked Dounia.

At first I said I would not take any message to you. Then he said that
he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help.
He assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation now he
has no feeling for you. He doesnt want you to marry Luzhin.... His talk
was altogether rather muddled.

How do you explain him to yourself Rodya? How did he strike you?

I must confess I dont quite understand him. He offers you ten
thousand and yet says he is not well off. He says he is going away and
in ten minutes he forgets he has said it. Then he says he is going to be
married and has already fixed on the girl.... No doubt he has a motive
and probably a bad one. But its odd that he should be so clumsy about
it if he had any designs against you.... Of course I refused this
money on your account once for all. Altogether I thought him very
strange.... One might almost think he was mad. But I may be mistaken;
that may only be the part he assumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems
to have made a great impression on him.

God rest her soul exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. I shall always
always pray for her! Where should we be now Dounia without this three
thousand! Its as though it had fallen from heaven! Why Rodya this
morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were
just planning to pawn her watch so as to avoid borrowing from that man
until he offered help.

Dounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigalovs offer. She still
stood meditating.

He has got some terrible plan she said in a half whisper to herself
almost shuddering.

Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.

I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again he said to
Dounia.

We will watch him! I will track him out! cried Razumihin vigorously.
I wont lose sight of him. Rodya has given me leave. He said to me
himself just now. Take care of my sister. Will you give me leave too
Avdotya Romanovna?

Dounia smiled and held out her hand but the look of anxiety did not
leave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly but the
three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her.

A quarter of an hour later they were all engaged in a lively
conversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time
though he did not talk. Razumihin was the speaker.

And why why should you go away? he flowed on ecstatically. And what
are you to do in a little town? The great thing is you are all here
together and you need one another--you do need one another believe me.
For a time anyway.... Take me into partnership and I assure you well
plan a capital enterprise. Listen! Ill explain it all in detail to
you the whole project! It all flashed into my head this morning
before anything had happened... I tell you what; I have an uncle I must
introduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man).
This uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles and he lives on his
pension and has no need of that money. For the last two years he has
been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent.
interest. I know what that means; he simply wants to help me. Last year
I had no need of it but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon as
he arrived. Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have
enough for a start so well go into partnership and what are we going
to do?

Then Razumihin began to unfold his project and he explained at length
that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all
of what they are selling and for that reason they are usually bad
publishers and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give
a profit sometimes a considerable one. Razumihin had indeed been
dreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he had
been working in publishers offices and knew three European languages
well though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he was
schwach in German with an object of persuading him to take half his
translation and half the payment for it. He had told a lie then and
Raskolnikov knew he was lying.

Why why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief
means of success--money of our own! cried Razumihin warmly. Of course
there will be a lot of work but we will work you Avdotya Romanovna
I Rodion.... You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And
the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants
translating and we shall be translating publishing learning all at
once. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years
Ive been scuttling about among the publishers and now I know every
detail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots believe
me! And why why should we let our chance slip! Why I know--and I kept
the secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles
simply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed and I would
not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do you
think? If I were to tell a publisher I dare say hed hesitate--they are
such blockheads! And as for the business side printing paper selling
you trust to me I know my way about. Well begin in a small way and go
on to a large. In any case it will get us our living and we shall get
back our capital.

Dounias eyes shone.

I like what you are saying Dmitri Prokofitch! she said.

I know nothing about it of course put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna
it may be a good idea but again God knows. Its new and untried. Of
course we must remain here at least for a time. She looked at Rodya.

What do you think brother? said Dounia.

I think hes got a very good idea he answered. Of course its too
soon to dream of a publishing firm but we certainly might bring out
five or six books and be sure of success. I know of one book myself
which would be sure to go well. And as for his being able to manage it
theres no doubt about that either. He knows the business.... But we can
talk it over later....

Hurrah! cried Razumihin. Now stay theres a flat here in this
house belonging to the same owner. Its a special flat apart not
communicating with these lodgings. Its furnished rent moderate
three rooms. Suppose you take them to begin with. Ill pawn your watch
to-morrow and bring you the money and everything can be arranged then.
You can all three live together and Rodya will be with you. But where
are you off to Rodya?

What Rodya you are going already? Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in
dismay.

At such a minute? cried Razumihin.

Dounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder. He held his cap in
his hand he was preparing to leave them.

One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever he
said somewhat oddly. He attempted to smile but it did not turn out a
smile. But who knows perhaps it is the last time we shall see each
other... he let slip accidentally. It was what he was thinking and it
somehow was uttered aloud.

What is the matter with you? cried his mother.

Where are you going Rodya? asked Dounia rather strangely.

Oh Im quite obliged to... he answered vaguely as though hesitating
what he would say. But there was a look of sharp determination in his
white face.

I meant to say... as I was coming here... I meant to tell you mother
and you Dounia that it would be better for us to part for a time. I
feel ill I am not at peace.... I will come afterwards I will come of
myself... when its possible. I remember you and love you.... Leave me
leave me alone. I decided this even before... Im absolutely resolved on
it. Whatever may come to me whether I come to ruin or not I want to be
alone. Forget me altogether its better. Dont inquire about me. When
I can Ill come of myself or... Ill send for you. Perhaps it will all
come back but now if you love me give me up... else I shall begin to
hate you I feel it.... Good-bye!

Good God! cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Both his mother and his sister
were terribly alarmed. Razumihin was also.

Rodya Rodya be reconciled with us! Let us be as before! cried his
poor mother.

He turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room. Dounia
overtook him.

Brother what are you doing to mother? she whispered her eyes
flashing with indignation.

He looked dully at her.

No matter I shall come.... Im coming he muttered in an undertone
as though not fully conscious of what he was saying and he went out of
the room.

Wicked heartless egoist! cried Dounia.

He is insane but not heartless. He is mad! Dont you see it? Youre
heartless after that! Razumihin whispered in her ear squeezing
her hand tightly. I shall be back directly he shouted to the
horror-stricken mother and he ran out of the room.

Raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage.

I knew you would run after me he said. Go back to them--be with
them... be with them to-morrow and always.... I... perhaps I shall
come... if I can. Good-bye.

And without holding out his hand he walked away.

But where are you going? What are you doing? Whats the matter with
you? How can you go on like this? Razumihin muttered at his wits end.

Raskolnikov stopped once more.

Once for all never ask me about anything. I have nothing to tell you.
Dont come to see me. Maybe Ill come here.... Leave me but _dont
leave_ them. Do you understand me?

It was dark in the corridor they were standing near the lamp. For a
minute they were looking at one another in silence. Razumihin remembered
that minute all his life. Raskolnikovs burning and intent eyes
grew more penetrating every moment piercing into his soul into his
consciousness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange as it
were passed between them.... Some idea some hint as it were slipped
something awful hideous and suddenly understood on both sides....
Razumihin turned pale.

Do you understand now? said Raskolnikov his face twitching nervously.
Go back go to them he said suddenly and turning quickly he went
out of the house.

I will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies
how he soothed them how he protested that Rodya needed rest in his
illness protested that Rodya was sure to come that he would come every
day that he was very very much upset that he must not be irritated
that he Razumihin would watch over him would get him a doctor the
best doctor a consultation.... In fact from that evening Razumihin took
his place with them as a son and a brother.



CHAPTER IV

Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia
lived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found the
porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of
Kapernaumov the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyard
the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase he mounted to the second
floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey
over the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness uncertain where
to turn for Kapernaumovs door a door opened three paces from him; he
mechanically took hold of it.

Who is there? a womans voice asked uneasily.

Its I... come to see you answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the
tiny entry.

On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.

Its you! Good heavens! cried Sonia weakly and she stood rooted to
the spot.

Which is your room? This way? and Raskolnikov trying not to look at
her hastened in.

A minute later Sonia too came in with the candle set down the
candlestick and completely disconcerted stood before him inexpressibly
agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour
rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She
felt sick and ashamed and happy too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly
and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.

It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room the only one let by the
Kapernaumovs to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.
In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door always
kept locked. That led to the next flat which formed a separate lodging.
Sonias room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and
this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking
out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute
angle and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.
The other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any
furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead
beside it nearest the door a chair. A plain deal table covered by a
blue cloth stood against the same wall close to the door into the other
flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite
wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers
looking as it were lost in a desert. That was all there was in the
room. The yellow scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the
corners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There
was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.

Sonia looked in silence at her visitor who was so attentively and
unceremoniously scrutinising her room and even began at last to tremble
with terror as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter
of her destinies.

I am late.... Its eleven isnt it? he asked still not lifting his
eyes.

Yes muttered Sonia oh yes it is she added hastily as though in
that lay her means of escape. My landladys clock has just struck... I
heard it myself....

Ive come to you for the last time Raskolnikov went on gloomily
although this was the first time. I may perhaps not see you again...

Are you... going away?

I dont know... to-morrow....

Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow? Sonias voice
shook.

I dont know. I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: Ive
come to say one word....

He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was
sitting down while she was all the while standing before him.

Why are you standing? Sit down he said in a changed voice gentle and
friendly.

She sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.

How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent like a dead hand.

He took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.

I have always been like that she said.

Even when you lived at home?

Yes.

Of course you were he added abruptly and the expression of his face
and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly.

He looked round him once more.

You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?

Yes....

They live there through that door?

Yes.... They have another room like this.

All in one room?

Yes.

I should be afraid in your room at night he observed gloomily.

They are very good people very kind answered Sonia who still seemed
bewildered and all the furniture everything... everything is theirs.
And they are very kind and the children too often come to see me.

They all stammer dont they?

Yes.... He stammers and hes lame. And his wife too.... Its not
exactly that she stammers but she cant speak plainly. She is a very
kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven
children... and its only the eldest one that stammers and the others
are simply ill... but they dont stammer.... But where did you hear
about them? she added with some surprise.

Your father told me then. He told me all about you.... And how you
went out at six oclock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna
knelt down by your bed.

Sonia was confused.

I fancied I saw him to-day she whispered hesitatingly.

Whom?

Father. I was walking in the street out there at the corner about ten
oclock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. I
wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna....

You were walking in the streets?

Yes Sonia whispered abruptly again overcome with confusion and
looking down.

Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you I dare say?

Oh no what are you saying? No! Sonia looked at him almost with
dismay.

You love her then?

Love her? Of course! said Sonia with plaintive emphasis and she
clasped her hands in distress. Ah you dont.... If you only knew!
You see she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite unhinged you
see... from sorrow. And how clever she used to be... how generous... how
kind! Ah you dont understand you dont understand!

Sonia said this as though in despair wringing her hands in excitement
and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed there was a look of anguish in
her eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths that
she was longing to speak to champion to express something. A sort
of _insatiable_ compassion if one may so express it was reflected in
every feature of her face.

Beat me! how can you? Good heavens beat me! And if she did beat me
what then? What of it? You know nothing nothing about it.... She is so
unhappy... ah how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness
she is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness
everywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her she
wouldnt do wrong. She doesnt see that its impossible for people to
be righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child like a child. She is
good!

And what will happen to you?

Sonia looked at him inquiringly.

They are left on your hands you see. They were all on your hands
before though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well
how will it be now?

I dont know Sonia articulated mournfully.

Will they stay there?

I dont know.... They are in debt for the lodging but the landlady
I hear said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them and Katerina
Ivanovna says that she wont stay another minute.

How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?

Oh no dont talk like that.... We are one we live like one. Sonia
was agitated again and even angry as though a canary or some other
little bird were to be angry. And what could she do? What what could
she do? she persisted getting hot and excited. And how she cried
to-day! Her mind is unhinged havent you noticed it? At one minute she
is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow the
lunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands spitting blood
weeping and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the
wall in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her
hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will
borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and
set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to
superintend it and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses
and hugs me comforts me and you know she has such faith such faith in
her fancies! One cant contradict her. And all the day long she has been
washing cleaning mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with
her feeble hands and sank on the bed gasping for breath. We went this
morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are
quite worn out. Only the money wed reckoned wasnt enough not nearly
enough. And she picked out such dear little boots for she has taste
you dont know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the
shopmen because she hadnt enough.... Ah it was sad to see her....

Well after that I can understand your living like this Raskolnikov
said with a bitter smile.

And arent you sorry for them? Arent you sorry? Sonia flew at him
again. Why I know you gave your last penny yourself though youd
seen nothing of it and if youd seen everything oh dear! And how
often how often Ive brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes I! Only
a week before his death. I was cruel! And how often Ive done it! Ah
Ive been wretched at the thought of it all day!

Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.

You were cruel?

Yes I--I. I went to see them she went on weeping and father said
read me something Sonia my head aches read to me heres a book. He
had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov he lives
there he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said I
cant stay as I didnt want to read and Id gone in chiefly to show
Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta the pedlar sold me some
collars and cuffs cheap pretty new embroidered ones. Katerina
Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself
in the glass and was delighted with them. Make me a present of them
Sonia she said please do. _Please do_ she said she wanted them
so much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old
happy days. She looked at herself in the glass admired herself and she
has no clothes at all no things of her own hasnt had all these years!
And she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud shed sooner give
away everything. And these she asked for she liked them so much. And I
was sorry to give them. What use are they to you Katerina Ivanovna? I
said. I spoke like that to her I ought not to have said that! She gave
me such a look. And she was so grieved so grieved at my refusing her.
And it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars
but for my refusing I saw that. Ah if only I could bring it all back
change it take back those words! Ah if I... but its nothing to you!

Did you know Lizaveta the pedlar?

Yes.... Did you know her? Sonia asked with some surprise.

Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption rapid consumption; she will soon
die said Raskolnikov after a pause without answering her question.

Oh no no no!

And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands as though imploring
that she should not.

But it will be better if she does die.

No not better not at all better! Sonia unconsciously repeated in
dismay.

And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?

Oh I dont know cried Sonia almost in despair and she put her
hands to her head.

It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and
he had only roused it again.

And what if even now while Katerina Ivanovna is alive you get ill
and are taken to the hospital what will happen then? he persisted
pitilessly.

How can you? That cannot be!

And Sonias face worked with awful terror.

Cannot be? Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. You are not
insured against it are you? What will happen to them then? They will
be in the street all of them she will cough and beg and knock her head
against some wall as she did to-day and the children will cry....
Then she will fall down be taken to the police station and to the
hospital she will die and the children...

Oh no.... God will not let it be! broke at last from Sonias
overburdened bosom.

She listened looking imploringly at him clasping her hands in dumb
entreaty as though it all depended upon him.

Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed.
Sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible
dejection.

And cant you save? Put by for a rainy day? he asked stopping
suddenly before her.

No whispered Sonia.

Of course not. Have you tried? he added almost ironically.

Yes.

And it didnt come off! Of course not! No need to ask.

And again he paced the room. Another minute passed.

You dont get money every day?

Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.

No she whispered with a painful effort.

It will be the same with Polenka no doubt he said suddenly.

No no! It cant be no! Sonia cried aloud in desperation as though
she had been stabbed. God would not allow anything so awful!

He lets others come to it.

No no! God will protect her God! she repeated beside herself.

But perhaps there is no God at all Raskolnikov answered with a sort
of malignance laughed and looked at her.

Sonias face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at
him with unutterable reproach tried to say something but could not
speak and broke into bitter bitter sobs hiding her face in her hands.

You say Katerina Ivanovnas mind is unhinged; your own mind is
unhinged he said after a brief silence.

Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence not
looking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put
his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful
face. His eyes were hard feverish and piercing his lips were
twitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the
ground kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And
certainly he looked like a madman.

What are you doing to me? she muttered turning pale and a sudden
anguish clutched at her heart.

He stood up at once.

I did not bow down to you I bowed down to all the suffering of
humanity he said wildly and walked away to the window. Listen he
added turning to her a minute later. I said just now to an insolent
man that he was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sister
honour making her sit beside you.

Ach you said that to them! And in her presence? cried Sonia
frightened. Sit down with me! An honour! Why Im... dishonourable....
Ah why did you say that?

It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you
but because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner thats
true he added almost solemnly and your worst sin is that you have
destroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_. Isnt that fearful? Isnt
it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so and at
the same time you know yourself (youve only to open your eyes) that you
are not helping anyone by it not saving anyone from anything? Tell me
 he went on almost in a frenzy how this shame and degradation can exist
in you side by side with other opposite holy feelings? It would be
better a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end
it all!

But what would become of them? Sonia asked faintly gazing at him with
eyes of anguish but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.

Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she
must have had that thought already perhaps many times and earnestly
she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly that
now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed
the cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his
peculiar attitude to her shame she had of course not noticed either
and that too was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought
of her disgraceful shameful position was torturing her and had long
tortured her. What what he thought could hitherto have hindered
her from putting an end to it? Only then he realised what those poor
little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna
knocking her head against the wall in her consumption meant for Sonia.

But nevertheless it was clear to him again that with her character and
the amount of education she had after all received she could not in any
case remain so. He was still confronted by the question how could she
have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind
since she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he
knew that Sonias position was an exceptional case though unhappily not
unique and not infrequent indeed; but that very exceptionalness her
tinge of education her previous life might one would have thought
have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her
up--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched
her mechanically not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her
heart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....

There are three ways before her he thought the canal the madhouse
or... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns
the heart to stone.

The last idea was the most revolting but he was a sceptic he was
young abstract and therefore cruel and so he could not help believing
that the last end was the most likely.

But can that be true? he cried to himself. Can that creature who has
still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last
into that sink of filth and iniquity? Can the process already have
begun? Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now
because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her? No no that cannot
be! he cried as Sonia had just before. No what has kept her from the
canal till now is the idea of sin and they the children.... And if she
has not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her
mind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk can one reason as she does?
How can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she
is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she
expect a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesnt that all mean madness?

He stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeed
better than any other. He began looking more intently at her.

So you pray to God a great deal Sonia? he asked her.

Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.

What should I be without God? she whispered rapidly forcibly
glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes and squeezing his hand.

Ah so that is it! he thought.

And what does God do for you? he asked probing her further.

Sonia was silent a long while as though she could not answer. Her weak
chest kept heaving with emotion.

Be silent! Dont ask! You dont deserve! she cried suddenly looking
sternly and wrathfully at him.

Thats it thats it he repeated to himself.

He does everything she whispered quickly looking down again.

Thats the way out! Thats the explanation he decided scrutinising
her with eager curiosity with a new strange almost morbid feeling.
He gazed at that pale thin irregular angular little face those soft
blue eyes which could flash with such fire such stern energy that
little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed
to him more and more strange almost impossible. She is a religious
maniac! he repeated to himself.

There was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had noticed it every
time he paced up and down the room. Now he took it up and looked at it.
It was the New Testament in the Russian translation. It was bound in
leather old and worn.

Where did you get that? he called to her across the room.

She was still standing in the same place three steps from the table.

It was brought me she answered as it were unwillingly not looking
at him.

Who brought it?

Lizaveta I asked her for it.

Lizaveta! strange! he thought.

Everything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every
moment. He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the
pages.

Where is the story of Lazarus? he asked suddenly.

Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer. She was
standing sideways to the table.

Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me Sonia.

She stole a glance at him.

You are not looking in the right place.... Its in the fourth gospel
 she whispered sternly without looking at him.

Find it and read it to me he said. He sat down with his elbow on the
table leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly prepared to
listen.

In three weeks time theyll welcome me in the madhouse! I shall be
there if I am not in a worse place he muttered to himself.

Sonia heard Raskolnikovs request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly
to the table. She took the book however.

Havent you read it? she asked looking up at him across the table.

Her voice became sterner and sterner.

Long ago.... When I was at school. Read!

And havent you heard it in church?

I... havent been. Do you often go?

N-no whispered Sonia.

Raskolnikov smiled.

I understand.... And you wont go to your fathers funeral to-morrow?

Yes I shall. I was at church last week too... I had a requiem
service.

For whom?

For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.

His nerves were more and more strained. His head began to go round.

Were you friends with Lizaveta?

Yes.... She was good... she used to come... not often... she
couldnt.... We used to read together and... talk. She will see God.

The last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something new
again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religious
maniacs.

I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! Its infectious!

Read! he cried irritably and insistently.

Sonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read
to him. He looked almost with exasperation at the unhappy lunatic.

What for? You dont believe?... she whispered softly and as it were
breathlessly.

Read! I want you to he persisted. You used to read to Lizaveta.

Sonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking her
voice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the
first syllable.

Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany... she forced
herself at last to read but at the third word her voice broke like an
overstrained string. There was a catch in her breath.

Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him
and the more he saw this the more roughly and irritably he insisted on
her doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for her
to betray and unveil all that was her _own_. He understood that these
feelings really were her _secret treasure_ which she had kept perhaps
for years perhaps from childhood while she lived with an unhappy
father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief in the midst of
starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same
time he knew now and knew for certain that although it filled her with
dread and suffering yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read
to _him_ that he might hear it and to read _now_ whatever might come of
it!... He read this in her eyes he could see it in her intense emotion.
She mastered herself controlled the spasm in her throat and went on
reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth
verse:

And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning
their brother.

Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met
Him: but Mary sat still in the house.

Then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if Thou hadst been here my brother
had not died.

But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God God will give
it Thee....

Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would
quiver and break again.

Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again.

Martha saith unto Him I know that he shall rise again in the
resurrection at the last day.

Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life: he that
believeth in Me though he were dead yet shall he live.

And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest
thou this?

She saith unto Him

(And drawing a painful breath Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as
though she were making a public confession of faith.)

Yea Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ the Son of God Which
should come into the world.

She stopped and looked up quickly at him but controlling herself went
on reading. Raskolnikov sat without moving his elbows on the table and
his eyes turned away. She read to the thirty-second verse.

Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him she fell down at
His feet saying unto Him Lord if Thou hadst been here my brother had
not died.

When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which
came with her He groaned in the spirit and was troubled

And said Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him Lord come and
see.

Jesus wept.

Then said the Jews behold how He loved him!

And some of them said could not this Man which opened the eyes of the
blind have caused that even this man should not have died?

Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes he had known it!
She was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She was
getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense
triumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy
gave it power. The lines danced before her eyes but she knew what she
was reading by heart. At the last verse Could not this Man which opened
the eyes of the blind... dropping her voice she passionately reproduced
the doubt the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews who
in another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by
thunder sobbing and believing.... And _he he_--too is blinded and
unbelieving he too will hear he too will believe yes yes! At
once now was what she was dreaming and she was quivering with happy
anticipation.

Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a
cave and a stone lay upon it.

Jesus said Take ye away the stone. Martha the sister of him that was
dead saith unto Him Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been
dead four days.

She laid emphasis on the word _four_.

Jesus saith unto her Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest
believe thou shouldest see the glory of God?

Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.
And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said Father I thank Thee that Thou
hast heard Me.

And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which
stand by I said it that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.

And when He thus had spoken He cried with a loud voice Lazarus come
forth.

And he that was dead came forth.

(She read loudly cold and trembling with ecstasy as though she were
seeing it before her eyes.)

Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about
with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them Loose him and let him go.

Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which
Jesus did believed on Him.

She could read no more closed the book and got up from her chair
quickly.

That is all about the raising of Lazarus she whispered severely and
abruptly and turning away she stood motionless not daring to raise
her eyes to him. She still trembled feverishly. The candle-end was
flickering out in the battered candlestick dimly lighting up in the
poverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely
been reading together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.

I came to speak of something Raskolnikov said aloud frowning. He got
up and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes to him in silence. His face
was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in
it.

I have abandoned my family to-day he said my mother and sister. I
am not going to see them. Ive broken with them completely.

What for? asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with his mother and
sister had left a great impression which she could not analyse. She
heard his news almost with horror.

I have only you now he added. Let us go together.... Ive come to
you we are both accursed let us go our way together!

His eyes glittered as though he were mad Sonia thought in her turn.

Go where? she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back.

How do I know? I only know its the same road I know that and nothing
more. Its the same goal!

She looked at him and understood nothing. She knew only that he was
terribly infinitely unhappy.

No one of them will understand if you tell them but I have
understood. I need you that is why I have come to you.

I dont understand whispered Sonia.

Youll understand later. Havent you done the same? You too have
transgressed... have had the strength to transgress. You have laid
hands on yourself you have destroyed a life... _your own_ (its all the
same!). You might have lived in spirit and understanding but youll
end in the Hay Market.... But you wont be able to stand it and if
you remain alone youll go out of your mind like me. You are like a mad
creature already. So we must go together on the same road! Let us go!

What for? Whats all this for? said Sonia strangely and violently
agitated by his words.

What for? Because you cant remain like this thats why! You must look
things straight in the face at last and not weep like a child and cry
that God wont allow it. What will happen if you should really be taken
to the hospital to-morrow? She is mad and in consumption shell soon
die and the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka wont come to
grief? Havent you seen children here at the street corners sent out
by their mothers to beg? Ive found out where those mothers live and in
what surroundings. Children cant remain children there! At seven the
child is vicious and a thief. Yet children you know are the image of
Christ: theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. He bade us honour and love
them they are the humanity of the future....

Whats to be done whats to be done? repeated Sonia weeping
hysterically and wringing her hands.

Whats to be done? Break what must be broken once for all thats all
and take the suffering on oneself. What you dont understand? Youll
understand later.... Freedom and power and above all power! Over all
trembling creation and all the ant-heap!... Thats the goal remember
that! Thats my farewell message. Perhaps its the last time I shall
speak to you. If I dont come to-morrow youll hear of it all and then
remember these words. And some day later on in years to come youll
understand perhaps what they meant. If I come to-morrow Ill tell you
who killed Lizaveta.... Good-bye.

Sonia started with terror.

Why do you know who killed her? she asked chilled with horror
looking wildly at him.

I know and will tell... you only you. I have chosen you out. Im not
coming to you to ask forgiveness but simply to tell you. I chose you
out long ago to hear this when your father talked of you and when
Lizaveta was alive I thought of it. Good-bye dont shake hands.
To-morrow!

He went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But she herself was like
one insane and felt it. Her head was going round.

Good heavens how does he know who killed Lizaveta? What did those
words mean? Its awful! But at the same time _the idea_ did not enter
her head not for a moment! Oh he must be terribly unhappy!... He has
abandoned his mother and sister.... What for? What has happened? And
what had he in his mind? What did he say to her? He had kissed her foot
and said... said (yes he had said it clearly) that he could not live
without her.... Oh merciful heavens!

Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She jumped up from
time to time wept and wrung her hands then sank again into feverish
sleep and dreamt of Polenka Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta of reading
the gospel and him... him with pale face with burning eyes... kissing
her feet weeping.

On the other side of the door on the right which divided Sonias room
from Madame Resslichs flat was a room which had long stood empty. A
card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the
canal advertising it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the
rooms being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigalov had been
standing listening at the door of the empty room. When Raskolnikov went
out he stood still thought a moment went on tiptoe to his own room
which adjoined the empty one brought a chair and noiselessly carried it
to the door that led to Sonias room. The conversation had struck him
as interesting and remarkable and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much so
that he brought a chair that he might not in the future to-morrow for
instance have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour but
might listen in comfort.



CHAPTER V

When next morning at eleven oclock punctually Raskolnikov went into the
department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in
to Porfiry Petrovitch he was surprised at being kept waiting so long:
it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had expected
that they would pounce upon him. But he stood in the waiting-room and
people who apparently had nothing to do with him were continually
passing to and fro before him. In the next room which looked like an
office several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had
no notion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily and
suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard some
mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape. But there was
nothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty
details then other people no one seemed to have any concern with him.
He might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew stronger in him
that if that enigmatic man of yesterday that phantom sprung out of the
earth had seen everything they would not have let him stand and wait
like that. And would they have waited till he elected to appear at
eleven? Either the man had not yet given information or... or simply
he knew nothing had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)
and so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom
exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination. This conjecture
had begun to grow strong the day before in the midst of all his
alarm and despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh
conflict he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt a
rush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at
facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. What he dreaded above all was
meeting that man again; he hated him with an intense unmitigated hatred
and was afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was such
that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and
arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible
to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained
nerves. At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.

He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His study was a room
neither large nor small furnished with a large writing-table that
stood before a sofa upholstered in checked material a bureau a
bookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture
of polished yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door
beyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikovs entrance
Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in
and they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genial
and good-tempered air and it was only after a few minutes that
Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him as though he had
been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.

Ah my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain... began Porfiry
holding out both hands to him. Come sit down old man... or perhaps
you dont like to be called my dear fellow and old man!--_tout
court_? Please dont think it too familiar.... Here on the sofa.

Raskolnikov sat down keeping his eyes fixed on him. In our domain
 the apologies for familiarity the French phrase _tout court_ were all
characteristic signs.

He held out both hands to me but he did not give me one--he drew it
back in time struck him suspiciously. Both were watching each other
but when their eyes met quick as lightning they looked away.

I brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it all
right or shall I copy it again?

What? A paper? Yes yes dont be uneasy its all right Porfiry
Petrovitch said as though in haste and after he had said it he took the
paper and looked at it. Yes its all right. Nothing more is needed
 he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.

A minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the
table and put it on his bureau.

I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...
formally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman? Raskolnikov
was beginning again. Why did I put in I believe passed through
his mind in a flash. Why am I so uneasy at having put in that _I
believe_? came in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his
uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry at the first words at the
first looks had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions and that
this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering his emotion was
increasing. Its bad its bad! I shall say too much again.

Yes yes yes! Theres no hurry theres no hurry muttered Porfiry
Petrovitch moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim
as it were making dashes towards the window the bureau and the table
at one moment avoiding Raskolnikovs suspicious glance then again
standing still and looking him straight in the face.

His fat round little figure looked very strange like a ball rolling
from one side to the other and rebounding back.

Weve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here a
cigarette! he went on offering his visitor a cigarette. You know I am
receiving you here but my own quarters are through there you know my
government quarters. But I am living outside for the time I had to
have some repairs done here. Its almost finished now.... Government
quarters you know are a capital thing. Eh what do you think?

Yes a capital thing answered Raskolnikov looking at him almost
ironically.

A capital thing a capital thing repeated Porfiry Petrovitch as
though he had just thought of something quite different. Yes a capital
thing he almost shouted at last suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and
stopping short two steps from him.

This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the
serious brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.

But this stirred Raskolnikovs spleen more than ever and he could not
resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.

Tell me please he asked suddenly looking almost insolently at him
and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. I believe its a
sort of legal rule a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating
lawyers--to begin their attack from afar with a trivial or at least
an irrelevant subject so as to encourage or rather to divert the man
they are cross-examining to disarm his caution and then all at once to
give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question. Isnt
that so? Its a sacred tradition mentioned I fancy in all the manuals
of the art?

Yes yes.... Why do you imagine that was why I spoke about government
quarters... eh?

And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;
a good-humoured crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on his
forehead were smoothed out his eyes contracted his features broadened
and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh shaking all
over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter forced
himself to laugh too but when Porfiry seeing that he was laughing
broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson Raskolnikovs
repulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing scowled and
stared with hatred at Porfiry keeping his eyes fixed on him while his
intentionally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution on
both sides however for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in
his visitors face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with
which the visitor received it. The latter fact was very significant
in Raskolnikovs eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been
embarrassed just before either but that he Raskolnikov had perhaps
fallen into a trap; that there must be something some motive here
unknown to him; that perhaps everything was in readiness and in
another moment would break upon him...

He went straight to the point at once rose from his seat and took his
cap.

Porfiry Petrovitch he began resolutely though with considerable
irritation yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you
for some inquiries (he laid special stress on the word inquiries). I
have come and if you have anything to ask me ask it and if not allow
me to withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to be at the funeral
of that man who was run over of whom you... know also he added
feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at
his anger. I am sick of it all do you hear? and have long been. Its
partly what made me ill. In short he shouted feeling that the phrase
about his illness was still more out of place in short kindly examine
me or let me go at once. And if you must examine me do so in the
proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise and so meanwhile
good-bye as we have evidently nothing to keep us now.

Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I question you about?
 cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone instantly leaving off
laughing. Please dont disturb yourself he began fidgeting from place
to place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. Theres no hurry
theres no hurry its all nonsense. Oh no Im very glad youve come
to see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as for
my confounded laughter please excuse it Rodion Romanovitch. Rodion
Romanovitch? That is your name?... Its my nerves you tickled me
so with your witty observation; I assure you sometimes I shake with
laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... Im
often afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do or I
shall think you are angry...

Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened watching him still frowning
angrily. He did sit down but still held his cap.

I must tell you one thing about myself my dear Rodion Romanovitch
 Porfiry Petrovitch continued moving about the room and again avoiding
his visitors eyes. You see Im a bachelor a man of no consequence
and not used to society; besides I have nothing before me Im set Im
running to seed and... and have you noticed Rodion Romanovitch that in
our Petersburg circles if two clever men meet who are not intimate but
respect each other like you and me it takes them half an hour before
they can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb they sit
opposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of
conversation ladies for instance... people in high society always have
their subjects of conversation _cest de rigueur_ but people of the
middle sort like us thinking people that is are always tongue-tied
and awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of public
interest or whether it is we are so honest we dont want to deceive one
another I dont know. What do you think? Do put down your cap it
looks as if you were just going it makes me uncomfortable... I am so
delighted...

Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with
a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry
Petrovitch. Does he really want to distract my attention with his silly
babble?

I cant offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a
friend? Porfiry pattered on and you know all these official
duties... please dont mind my running up and down excuse it my dear
fellow I am very much afraid of offending you but exercise is
absolutely indispensable for me. Im always sitting and so glad to be
moving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... I
always intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks
even Privy Councillors may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have
it modern science... yes yes.... But as for my duties here inquiries
and all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...
I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for
the interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observation
yourself just now very aptly and wittily. (Raskolnikov had made no
observation of the kind.) One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One
keeps harping on the same note like a drum! There is to be a reform and
we shall be called by a different name at least he-he-he! And as for
our legal tradition as you so wittily called it I thoroughly agree
with you. Every prisoner on trial even the rudest peasant knows that
they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily
put it) and then deal him a knock-down blow he-he-he!--your felicitous
comparison he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by government
quarters... he-he! You are an ironical person. Come. I wont go on! Ah
by the way yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality just
now apropos of the inquiry you know. But whats the use of formality?
In many cases its nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets
a good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on formality allow
me to assure you. And after all what does it amount to? An examining
lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step. The work of
investigation is so to speak a free art in its own way he-he-he!

Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had simply babbled on
uttering empty phrases letting slip a few enigmatic words and again
reverting to incoherence. He was almost running about the room moving
his fat little legs quicker and quicker looking at the ground with his
right hand behind his back while with his left making gesticulations
that were extraordinarily incongruous with his words. Raskolnikov
suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop
for a moment near the door as though he were listening.

Is he expecting anything?

You are certainly quite right about it Porfiry began gaily looking
with extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov (which startled him and
instantly put him on his guard); certainly quite right in laughing so
wittily at our legal forms he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological
methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless if one adheres
too closely to the forms. Yes... I am talking of forms again. Well if
I recognise or more strictly speaking if I suspect someone or other to
be a criminal in any case entrusted to me... youre reading for the law
of course Rodion Romanovitch?

Yes I was...

Well then it is a precedent for you for the future--though dont
suppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish
about crime! No I simply make bold to state it by way of fact if I
took this man or that for a criminal why I ask should I worry him
prematurely even though I had evidence against him? In one case I may
be bound for instance to arrest a man at once but another may be in
quite a different position you know so why shouldnt I let him walk
about the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you dont quite understand so
Ill give you a clearer example. If I put him in prison too soon I
may very likely give him so to speak moral support he-he! Youre
laughing?

Raskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with compressed
lips his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitchs.

Yet that is the case with some types especially for men are so
different. You say evidence. Well there may be evidence. But
evidence you know can generally be taken two ways. I am an examining
lawyer and a weak man I confess it. I should like to make a proof so
to say mathematically clear. I should like to make a chain of evidence
such as twice two are four it ought to be a direct irrefutable proof!
And if I shut him up too soon--even though I might be convinced _he_
was the man I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of
getting further evidence against him. And how? By giving him so to
speak a definite position I shall put him out of suspense and set his
mind at rest so that he will retreat into his shell. They say that at
Sevastopol soon after Alma the clever people were in a terrible fright
that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once. But when
they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege they were delighted
I am told and reassured for the thing would drag on for two months at
least. Youre laughing you dont believe me again? Of course youre
right too. Youre right youre right. These are special cases I
admit. But you must observe this my dear Rodion Romanovitch the
general case the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended
for which they are calculated and laid down in books does not exist at
all for the reason that every case every crime for instance so soon
as it actually occurs at once becomes a thoroughly special case and
sometimes a case unlike any thats gone before. Very comic cases of that
sort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone if I dont touch
him and dont worry him but let him know or at least suspect every
moment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night and
if he is in continual suspicion and terror hell be bound to lose his
head. Hell come of himself or maybe do something which will make it as
plain as twice two are four--its delightful. It may be so with a simple
peasant but with one of our sort an intelligent man cultivated on a
certain side its a dead certainty. For my dear fellow its a very
important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated. And then
there are nerves there are nerves you have overlooked them! Why they
are all sick nervous and irritable!... And then how they all suffer
from spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And its
no anxiety to me his running about the town free! Let him let him walk
about for a bit! I know well enough that Ive caught him and that he
wont escape me. Where could he escape to he-he? Abroad perhaps? A
Pole will escape abroad but not here especially as I am watching
and have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of the country
perhaps? But you know peasants live there real rude Russian peasants.
A modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such
strangers as our peasants. He-he! But thats all nonsense and on
the surface. Its not merely that he has nowhere to run to he is
_psychologically_ unable to escape me he-he! What an expression!
Through a law of nature he cant escape me if he had anywhere to go.
Have you seen a butterfly round a candle? Thats how he will keep
circling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its attractions. Hell
begin to brood hell weave a tangle round himself hell worry himself
to death! Whats more he will provide me with a mathematical proof--if I
only give him long enough interval.... And hell keep circling round
me getting nearer and nearer and then--flop! Hell fly straight into my
mouth and Ill swallow him and that will be very amusing he-he-he! You
dont believe me?

Raskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless still gazing with
the same intensity into Porfirys face.

Its a lesson he thought turning cold. This is beyond the cat
playing with a mouse like yesterday. He cant be showing off his power
with no motive... prompting me; he is far too clever for that... he must
have another object. What is it? Its all nonsense my friend you are
pretending to scare me! Youve no proofs and the man I saw had no
real existence. You simply want to make me lose my head to work me up
beforehand and so to crush me. But you are wrong you wont do it! But
why give me such a hint? Is he reckoning on my shattered nerves? No my
friend you are wrong you wont do it even though you have some trap
for me... let us see what you have in store for me.

And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal. At times
he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. This anger was what he
dreaded from the beginning. He felt that his parched lips were flecked
with foam his heart was throbbing. But he was still determined not to
speak till the right moment. He realised that this was the best
policy in his position because instead of saying too much he would be
irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too
freely. Anyhow this was what he hoped for.

No I see you dont believe me you think I am playing a harmless joke
on you Porfiry began again getting more and more lively chuckling
at every instant and again pacing round the room. And to be sure youre
right: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in
other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you and I repeat it excuse
an old man my dear Rodion Romanovitch you are a man still young so to
say in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything like
all young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and
thats for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_ as
far as I can judge of military matters that is: on paper theyd beaten
Napoleon and taken him prisoner and there in their study they worked it
all out in the cleverest fashion but look you General Mack surrendered
with all his army he-he-he! I see I see Rodion Romanovitch you are
laughing at a civilian like me taking examples out of military history!
But I cant help it its my weakness. I am fond of military science.
And Im ever so fond of reading all military histories. Ive certainly
missed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army upon my
word I ought. I shouldnt have been a Napoleon but I might have been a
major he-he! Well Ill tell you the whole truth my dear fellow about
this _special case_ I mean: actual fact and a mans temperament my
dear sir are weighty matters and its astonishing how they sometimes
deceive the sharpest calculation! I--listen to an old man--am speaking
seriously Rodion Romanovitch (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch who
was scarcely five-and-thirty actually seemed to have grown old; even
his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) Moreover Im
a candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy I
really am: I tell you these things for nothing and dont even expect a
reward for it he-he! Well to proceed wit in my opinion is a splendid
thing it is so to say an adornment of nature and a consolation of
life and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a
poor examining lawyer to know where he is especially when hes liable
to be carried away by his own fancy too for you know he is a man after
all! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminals temperament worse
luck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit dont think
of that when they overstep all obstacles as you wittily and cleverly
expressed it yesterday. He will lie--that is the man who is a _special
case_ the incognito and he will lie well in the cleverest fashion;
you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit but at
the most interesting the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of course
there may be illness and a stuffy room as well but anyway! Anyway hes
given us the idea! He lied incomparably but he didnt reckon on his
temperament. Thats what betrays him! Another time he will be carried
away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him he
will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead but his paleness will
be _too natural_ too much like the real thing again he has given us
an idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first he will think
differently next day if he is not a fool and of course it is like
that at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted
speaks continually when he ought to keep silent brings in all sorts of
allegorical allusions he-he! Comes and asks why didnt you take me long
ago? he-he-he! And that can happen you know with the cleverest man
the psychologist the literary man. The temperament reflects everything
like a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you so
pale Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room stuffy? Shall I open the window?

Oh dont trouble please cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke
into a laugh. Please dont trouble.

Porfiry stood facing him paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.
Raskolnikov got up from the sofa abruptly checking his hysterical
laughter.

Porfiry Petrovitch he began speaking loudly and distinctly though
his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. I see clearly at last
that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister
Lizaveta. Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you
find that you have a right to prosecute me legally to arrest me then
prosecute me arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered at to my
face and worried...

His lips trembled his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain
his voice.

I wont allow it! he shouted bringing his fist down on the table. Do
you hear that Porfiry Petrovitch? I wont allow it.

Good heavens! What does it mean? cried Porfiry Petrovitch apparently
quite frightened. Rodion Romanovitch my dear fellow what is the
matter with you?

I wont allow it Raskolnikov shouted again.

Hush my dear man! Theyll hear and come in. Just think what could we
say to them? Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror bringing his face
close to Raskolnikovs.

I wont allow it I wont allow it Raskolnikov repeated mechanically
but he too spoke in a sudden whisper.

Porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.

Some fresh air! And you must have some water my dear fellow. Youre
ill! and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a
decanter of water in the corner. Come drink a little he whispered
rushing up to him with the decanter. It will be sure to do you good.

Porfiry Petrovitchs alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov
was silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity. He did not take
the water however.

Rodion Romanovitch my dear fellow youll drive yourself out of your
mind I assure you ach ach! Have some water do drink a little.

He forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to
his lips but set it on the table again with disgust.

Yes youve had a little attack! Youll bring back your illness again
my dear fellow Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy
though he still looked rather disconcerted. Good heavens you must
take more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here came to see me
yesterday--I know I know Ive a nasty ironical temper but what they
made of it!... Good heavens he came yesterday after youd been. We
dined and he talked and talked away and I could only throw up my hands
in despair! Did he come from you? But do sit down for mercys sake sit
down!

No not from me but I knew he went to you and why he went
 Raskolnikov answered sharply.

You knew?

I knew. What of it?

Why this Rodion Romanovitch that I know more than that about you;
I know about everything. I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night
when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood so
that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes I
understand your state of mind at that time... but youll drive yourself
mad like that upon my word! Youll lose your head! Youre full of
generous indignation at the wrongs youve received first from destiny
and then from the police officers and so you rush from one thing to
another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all because
you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. Thats so isnt
it? I have guessed how you feel havent I? Only in that way youll
lose your head and Razumihins too; hes too _good_ a man for such
a position you must know that. You are ill and he is good and your
illness is infectious for him... Ill tell you about it when you are
more yourself.... But do sit down for goodness sake. Please rest you
look shocking do sit down.

Raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered he was hot all over. In
amazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who
still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.
But he did not believe a word he said though he felt a strange
inclination to believe. Porfirys unexpected words about the flat had
utterly overwhelmed him. How can it be he knows about the flat then
 he thought suddenly and he tells it me himself!

Yes in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar a
case of morbid psychology Porfiry went on quickly. A man confessed to
murder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought
forward facts he imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly but
only partly unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that
he had given the murderers the opportunity he sank into dejection it
got on his mind and turned his brain he began imagining things and he
persuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court
of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under
proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why my dear
fellow you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse
to work upon your nerves to go ringing bells at night and asking about
blood! Ive studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man
is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the
same with bell-ringing.... Its all illness Rodion Romanovitch! You
have begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced
doctor whats the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You
were delirious when you did all this!

For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.

Is it possible is it possible flashed through his mind that he is
still lying? He cant be he cant be. He rejected that idea feeling
to what a degree of fury it might drive him feeling that that fury
might drive him mad.

I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing he cried straining
every faculty to penetrate Porfirys game I was quite myself do you
hear?

Yes I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious
you were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tell
me! A-ach!... Listen Rodion Romanovitch my dear fellow. If you were
actually a criminal or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business
would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession
of your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be
possible? Quite impossible to my thinking. If you had anything on
your conscience you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.
Thats so isnt it?

There was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back on
the sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at
him.

Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he
came of his own accord to have concealed your part in it! But you dont
conceal it! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation.

Raskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his back.

You keep telling lies he said slowly and weakly twisting his lips
into a sickly smile you are trying again to show that you know all
my game that you know all I shall say beforehand he said conscious
himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought. You want to
frighten me... or you are simply laughing at me...

He still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of
intense hatred in his eyes.

You keep lying he said. You know perfectly well that the best
policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to
conceal as little as possible. I dont believe you!

What a wily person you are! Porfiry tittered theres no catching
you; youve a perfect monomania. So you dont believe me? But still you
do believe me you believe a quarter; Ill soon make you believe the
whole because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you
good.

Raskolnikovs lips trembled.

Yes I do went on Porfiry touching Raskolnikovs arm genially you
must take care of your illness. Besides your mother and sister are here
now; you must think of them. You must soothe and comfort them and you do
nothing but frighten them...

What has that to do with you? How do you know it? What concern is it of
yours? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?

Good heavens! Why I learnt it all from you yourself! You dont
notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything. From
Razumihin too I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No
you interrupted me but I must tell you that for all your wit your
suspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To return
to bell-ringing for instance. I an examining lawyer have betrayed a
precious thing like that a real fact (for it is a fact worth having)
and you see nothing in it! Why if I had the slightest suspicion of you
should I have acted like that? No I should first have disarmed your
suspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact should have diverted
your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your
expression) saying: And what were you doing sir pray at ten or
nearly eleven at the murdered womans flat and why did you ring the bell
and why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters
to go with you to the police station to the lieutenant? Thats how
I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to
have taken your evidence in due form searched your lodging and perhaps
have arrested you too... so I have no suspicion of you since I have
not done that! But you cant look at it normally and you see nothing I
say again.

Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to
perceive it.

You are lying all the while he cried I dont know your object
but you are lying. You did not speak like that just now and I cannot be
mistaken!

I am lying? Porfiry repeated apparently incensed but preserving
a good-humoured and ironical face as though he were not in the least
concerned at Raskolnikovs opinion of him. I am lying... but how did
I treat you just now I the examining lawyer? Prompting you and giving
you every means for your defence; illness I said delirium injury
melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! He-he-he!
Though indeed all those psychological means of defence are not very
reliable and cut both ways: illness delirium I dont remember--thats
all right but why my good sir in your illness and in your delirium
were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others? There
may have been others eh? He-he-he!

Raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him.

Briefly he said loudly and imperiously rising to his feet and in so
doing pushing Porfiry back a little briefly I want to know do you
acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not? Tell me Porfiry
Petrovitch tell me once for all and make haste!

What a business Im having with you! cried Porfiry with a perfectly
good-humoured sly and composed face. And why do you want to know why
do you want to know so much since they havent begun to worry you? Why
you are like a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? Why
do you force yourself upon us eh? He-he-he!

I repeat Raskolnikov cried furiously that I cant put up with it!

With what? Uncertainty? interrupted Porfiry.

Dont jeer at me! I wont have it! I tell you I wont have it. I cant
and I wont do you hear do you hear? he shouted bringing his fist
down on the table again.

Hush! Hush! Theyll overhear! I warn you seriously take care of
yourself. I am not joking Porfiry whispered but this time there was
not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face. Now
he was peremptory stern frowning and for once laying aside all
mystification.

But this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov bewildered suddenly fell
into actual frenzy but strange to say he again obeyed the command to
speak quietly though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.

I will not allow myself to be tortured he whispered instantly
recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and
driven to even greater fury by the thought. Arrest me search me but
kindly act in due form and dont play with me! Dont dare!

Dont worry about the form Porfiry interrupted with the same sly
smile as it were gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov. I invited
you to see me quite in a friendly way.

I dont want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you hear? And here
I take my cap and go. What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?

He took up his cap and went to the door.

And wont you see my little surprise? chuckled Porfiry again taking
him by the arm and stopping him at the door.

He seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened
Raskolnikov.

What surprise? he asked standing still and looking at Porfiry in
alarm.

My little surprise its sitting there behind the door he-he-he!
 (He pointed to the locked door.) I locked him in that he should not
escape.

What is it? Where? What?...

Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it but it was
locked.

Its locked here is the key!

And he brought a key out of his pocket.

You are lying roared Raskolnikov without restraint you lie you
damned punchinello! and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other
door not at all alarmed.

I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I may betray
myself to you...

Why you could not betray yourself any further my dear Rodion
Romanovitch. You are in a passion. Dont shout I shall call the
clerks.

You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and tried to work
me into a frenzy to make me betray myself that was your object! Produce
your facts! I understand it all. Youve no evidence you have only
wretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametovs! You knew my character you
wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and
deputies.... Are you waiting for them? eh! What are you waiting for?
Where are they? Produce them?

Why deputies my good man? What things people will imagine! And to do
so would not be acting in form as you say you dont know the business
my dear fellow.... And theres no escaping form as you see Porfiry
muttered listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.

Ah theyre coming cried Raskolnikov. Youve sent for them! You
expected them! Well produce them all: your deputies your witnesses
what you like!... I am ready!

But at this moment a strange incident occurred something so unexpected
that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for
such a conclusion to their interview.



CHAPTER VI

When he remembered the scene afterwards this is how Raskolnikov saw it.

The noise behind the door increased and suddenly the door was opened a
little.

What is it? cried Porfiry Petrovitch annoyed. Why I gave orders...

For an instant there was no answer but it was evident that there were
several persons at the door and that they were apparently pushing
somebody back.

What is it? Porfiry Petrovitch repeated uneasily.

The prisoner Nikolay has been brought someone answered.

He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! Whats he doing here?
How irregular! cried Porfiry rushing to the door.

But he... began the same voice and suddenly ceased.

Two seconds not more were spent in actual struggle then someone gave
a violent shove and then a man very pale strode into the room.

This mans appearance was at first sight very strange. He stared
straight before him as though seeing nothing. There was a determined
gleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his
face as though he were being led to the scaffold. His white lips were
faintly twitching.

He was dressed like a workman and was of medium height very young
slim his hair cut in round crop with thin spare features. The man whom
he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing
him by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.

Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of them
tried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.

Go away its too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have you
brought him so soon? Porfiry Petrovitch muttered extremely annoyed
and as it were thrown out of his reckoning.

But Nikolay suddenly knelt down.

Whats the matter? cried Porfiry surprised.

I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer Nikolay articulated
suddenly rather breathless but speaking fairly loudly.

For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;
even the warder stepped back mechanically retreated to the door and
stood immovable.

What is it? cried Porfiry Petrovitch recovering from his momentary
stupefaction.

I... am the murderer repeated Nikolay after a brief pause.

What... you... what... whom did you kill? Porfiry Petrovitch was
obviously bewildered.

Nikolay again was silent for a moment.

Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna I... killed... with
an axe. Darkness came over me he added suddenly and was again silent.

He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some
moments as though meditating but suddenly roused himself and waved back
the uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door.
Then he looked towards Raskolnikov who was standing in the corner
staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him but stopped short
looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay and
seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.

Youre in too great a hurry he shouted at him almost angrily. I
didnt ask you what came over you.... Speak did you kill them?

I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence Nikolay pronounced.

Ach! What did you kill them with?

An axe. I had it ready.

Ach he is in a hurry! Alone?

Nikolay did not understand the question.

Did you do it alone?

Yes alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it.

Dont be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs
like that at the time? The porters met you both!

It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka Nikolay replied
hurriedly as though he had prepared the answer.

I knew it! cried Porfiry with vexation. Its not his own tale he is
telling he muttered as though to himself and suddenly his eyes rested
on Raskolnikov again.

He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had
forgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.

My dear Rodion Romanovitch excuse me! he flew up to him this wont
do; Im afraid you must go... its no good your staying... I will...
you see what a surprise!... Good-bye!

And taking him by the arm he showed him to the door.

I suppose you didnt expect it? said Raskolnikov who though he had
not yet fully grasped the situation had regained his courage.

You did not expect it either my friend. See how your hand is
trembling! He-he!

Youre trembling too Porfiry Petrovitch!

Yes I am; I didnt expect it.

They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to
be gone.

And your little surprise arent you going to show it to me?
 Raskolnikov said sarcastically.

Why his teeth are chattering as he asks he-he! You are an ironical
person! Come till we meet!

I believe we can say _good-bye_!

Thats in Gods hands muttered Porfiry with an unnatural smile.

As he walked through the office Raskolnikov noticed that many people
were looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house
whom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there
waiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of
Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round he saw the latter running
after him out of breath.

One word Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest its in Gods hands
but as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask
you... so we shall meet again shant we?

And Porfiry stood still facing him with a smile.

Shant we? he added again.

He seemed to want to say something more but could not speak out.

You must forgive me Porfiry Petrovitch for what has just passed... I
lost my temper began Raskolnikov who had so far regained his courage
that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.

Dont mention it dont mention it Porfiry replied almost gleefully.
I myself too... I have a wicked temper I admit it! But we shall meet
again. If its Gods will we may see a great deal of one another.

And will get to know each other through and through? added
Raskolnikov.

Yes; know each other through and through assented Porfiry Petrovitch
and he screwed up his eyes looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. Now
youre going to a birthday party?

To a funeral.

Of course the funeral! Take care of yourself and get well.

I dont know what to wish you said Raskolnikov who had begun to
descend the stairs but looked back again. I should like to wish you
success but your office is such a comical one.

Why comical? Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go but he seemed to
prick up his ears at this.

Why how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay
psychologically after your fashion till he confessed! You must have
been at him day and night proving to him that he was the murderer and
now that he has confessed youll begin vivisecting him again. You are
lying youll say. You are not the murderer! You cant be! Its not
your own tale you are telling! You must admit its a comical business!

He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was
not his own tale he was telling?

How could I help noticing it!

He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! Youve really a
playful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he! They say
that was the marked characteristic of Gogol among the writers.

Yes of Gogol.

Yes of Gogol.... I shall look forward to meeting you.

So shall I.

Raskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that
on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa trying to
collect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he
was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable
amazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolays confession
was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at
once its falsehood could not fail to be discovered and then they
would be after him again. Till then at least he was free and must do
something for himself for the danger was imminent.

But how imminent? His position gradually became clear to him.
Remembering sketchily the main outlines of his recent scene with
Porfiry he could not help shuddering again with horror. Of course
he did not yet know all Porfirys aims he could not see into all his
calculations. But he had already partly shown his hand and no one knew
better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfirys lead had been for
him. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely
circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first
glance seeing through him Porfiry though playing a bold game was
bound to win. Theres no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised
himself seriously but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was
nothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasnt
he mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he really some
surprise prepared for him? And what was it? Had he really been expecting
something or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for the
unexpected appearance of Nikolay?

Porfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course he had risked
something in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his
sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected) he would have shown that too. What was
that surprise? Was it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have
concealed anything like a fact a piece of positive evidence? His
yesterdays visitor? What had become of him? Where was he to-day? If
Porfiry really had any evidence it must be connected with him....

He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in
his hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up took his
cap thought a minute and went to the door.

He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day at least he might
consider himself out of danger. He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he
wanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovnas. He would be too late for
the funeral of course but he would be in time for the memorial dinner
and there at once he would see Sonia.

He stood still thought a moment and a suffering smile came for a
moment on to his lips.

To-day! To-day he repeated to himself. Yes to-day! So it must
be....

But as he was about to open the door it began opening of itself. He
started and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly and there
suddenly appeared a figure--yesterdays visitor _from underground_.

The man stood in the doorway looked at Raskolnikov without speaking
and took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same as
yesterday; the same figure the same dress but there was a great change
in his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put
his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have
looked exactly like a peasant woman.

What do you want? asked Raskolnikov numb with terror. The man was
still silent but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground touching
it with his finger.

What is it? cried Raskolnikov.

I have sinned the man articulated softly.

How?

By evil thoughts.

They looked at one another.

I was vexed. When you came perhaps in drink and bade the porters go
to the police station and asked about the blood I was vexed that they
let you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my
sleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for
you....

Who came? Raskolnikov interrupted instantly beginning to recollect.

I did Ive wronged you.

Then you come from that house?

I was standing at the gate with them... dont you remember? We have
carried on our trade in that house for years past. We cure and prepare
hides we take work home... most of all I was vexed....

And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came
clearly before Raskolnikovs mind; he recollected that there had
been several people there besides the porters women among them.
He remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the
police-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker and even
now he did not recognise it but he remembered that he had turned round
and made him some answer....

So this was the solution of yesterdays horror. The most awful thought
was that he had been actually almost lost had almost done for himself
on account of such a _trivial_ circumstance. So this man could tell
nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains. So
Porfiry too had nothing but that _delirium_ no facts but this
_psychology_ which _cuts both ways_ nothing positive. So if no more
facts come to light (and they must not they must not!) then... then
what can they do to him? How can they convict him even if they arrest
him? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not
known about it before.

Was it you who told Porfiry... that Id been there? he cried struck
by a sudden idea.

What Porfiry?

The head of the detective department?

Yes. The porters did not go there but I went.

To-day?

I got there two minutes before you. And I heard I heard it all how he
worried you.

Where? What? When?

Why in the next room. I was sitting there all the time.

What? Why then you were the surprise? But how could it happen? Upon my
word!

I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said began the man;
for its too late said they and maybe hell be angry that we did not
come at the time. I was vexed and I lost my sleep and I began making
inquiries. And finding out yesterday where to go I went to-day. The
first time I went he wasnt there when I came an hour later he couldnt
see me. I went the third time and they showed me in. I informed him of
everything just as it happened and he began skipping about the room
and punching himself on the chest. What do you scoundrels mean by it?
If Id known about it I should have arrested him! Then he ran out
called somebody and began talking to him in the corner then he turned
to me scolding and questioning me. He scolded me a great deal; and I
told him everything and I told him that you didnt dare to say a word
in answer to me yesterday and that you didnt recognise me. And he
fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest and
getting angry and running about and when you were announced he told
me to go into the next room. Sit there a bit he said. Dont move
whatever you may hear. And he set a chair there for me and locked
me in. Perhaps he said I may call you. And when Nikolayd been
brought he let me out as soon as you were gone. I shall send for you
again and question you he said.

And did he question Nikolay while you were there?

He got rid of me as he did of you before he spoke to Nikolay.

The man stood still and again suddenly bowed down touching the ground
with his finger.

Forgive me for my evil thoughts and my slander.

May God forgive you answered Raskolnikov.

And as he said this the man bowed down again but not to the ground
turned slowly and went out of the room.

It all cuts both ways now it all cuts both ways repeated
Raskolnikov and he went out more confident than ever.

Now well make a fight for it he said with a malicious smile as he
went down the stairs. His malice was aimed at himself; with shame and
contempt he recollected his cowardice.




PART V



CHAPTER I

The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and
her mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.
Intensely unpleasant as it was he was forced little by little to accept
as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before
fantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been
gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed Pyotr Petrovitch
immediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had
jaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far and looking at
his noble clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of
late Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the
conviction that he would find another bride and perhaps even a better
one. But coming back to the sense of his present position he turned
aside and spat vigorously which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey
Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov the young friend with whom he was staying.
That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed and at once set it down against his
young friends account. He had set down a good many points against him
of late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to
have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterdays interview.
That was the second mistake he had made in temper through impulsiveness
and irritability.... Moreover all that morning one unpleasantness
followed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case
in the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat
which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being
redecorated at his own expense; the owner a rich German tradesman
would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just
been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money though Pyotr
Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In
the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the
instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the
flat.

Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture? Pyotr
Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a
gleam of desperate hope. Can all that be really so irrevocably over?
Is it no use to make another effort? The thought of Dounia sent a
voluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment
and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it
Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.

It was my mistake too not to have given them money he thought as
he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikovs room and why on earth was I
such a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny
so that they should turn to me as their providence and look at them!
foo! If Id spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau
and presents on knick-knacks dressing-cases jewellery materials and
all that sort of trash from Knopps and the English shop my position
would have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused me
so easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return
money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to
do it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man
who has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... Hm! Ive made a
blunder.

And grinding his teeth again Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a
fool--but not aloud of course.

He returned home twice as irritated and angry as before. The
preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovnas excited
his curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it the day before; he
fancied indeed that he had been invited but absorbed in his own cares
he had paid no attention. Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy
laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery he
heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair that all the
lodgers had been invited among them some who had not known the dead
man that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of
his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna that he Pyotr Petrovitch
was not only invited but was eagerly expected as he was the most
important of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with
great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness and so she was
very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;
she was moreover dressed up to the nines all in new black silk and she
was proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he
went into his room or rather Lebeziatnikovs somewhat thoughtful. He
had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.

Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of
Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange though perhaps natural.
Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay
with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He
had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from
parsimony though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard
of Andrey Semyonovitch who had once been his ward as a leading young
progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting
circles the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had
impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who
despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a
peculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not of course been able to form
even an approximate notion of what they meant. He like everyone had
heard that there were especially in Petersburg progressives of some
sort nihilists and so on and like many people he exaggerated and
distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for
many years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown
up_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the
thought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of
this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before
when he was just entering on his own career he had come upon two cases
in which rather important personages in the province patrons of his
had been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal
for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious
trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the
subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and if necessary to
anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of our younger
generation. He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before
his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current
phrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace
simpleton but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he
had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him it
would not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines the ideas the
systems with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for
him. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what
was happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anything
to fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what
precisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up
to them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the
thing to do or not? Couldnt he gain something through them? In fact
hundreds of questions presented themselves.

Andrey Semyonovitch was an anmic scrofulous little man with strangely
flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerk
and had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was rather
soft-hearted but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in
speech which had an absurd effect incongruous with his little figure.
He was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna for he did
not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch
really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress
and our younger generation from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerous
and varied legion of dullards of half-animate abortions conceited
half-educated coxcombs who attach themselves to the idea most in
fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve
however sincerely.

Though Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured he too was beginning to
dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on both sides unconsciously.
However simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be he began to see that Pyotr
Petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him and that he was
not the right sort of man. He had tried expounding to him the system of
Fourier and the Darwinian theory but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to
listen too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun
instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace
simpleton but perhaps a liar too and that he had no connections of
any consequence even in his own circle but had simply picked things up
third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own
work of propaganda for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he
would be to show anyone up! It must be noted by the way that Pyotr
Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest
praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested for instance
when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to
the establishment of the new commune or to abstain from christening
his future children or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a
month after marriage and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing
his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were
attributed to him.

Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some
five-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over
bundles of notes. Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money
walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank
notes with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have convinced
Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money
unmoved and the latter on his side kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr
Petrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and
was perhaps glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by
reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them.

He found him incredibly inattentive and irritable though he Andrey
Semyonovitch began enlarging on his favourite subject the foundation
of a new special commune. The brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr
Petrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame
betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony. But the humane Andrey
Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitchs ill-humour to his recent breach
with Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that
theme. He had something progressive to say on the subject which
might console his worthy friend and could not fail to promote his
development.

There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at the
widows isnt there? Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly interrupting
Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage.

Why dont you know? Why I was telling you last night what I think
about all such ceremonies. And she invited you too I heard. You were
talking to her yesterday...

I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on
this feast all the money she got from that other fool Raskolnikov. I
was surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there the
wines! Several people are invited. Its beyond everything! continued
Pyotr Petrovitch who seemed to have some object in pursuing the
conversation. What? You say I am asked too? When was that? I dont
remember. But I shant go. Why should I? I only said a word to her in
passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a years salary as
a destitute widow of a government clerk. I suppose she has invited me on
that account hasnt she? He-he-he!

I dont intend to go either said Lebeziatnikov.

I should think not after giving her a thrashing! You might well
hesitate he-he!

Who thrashed? Whom? cried Lebeziatnikov flustered and blushing.

Why you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard so
yesterday... so thats what your convictions amount to... and the woman
question too wasnt quite sound he-he-he! and Pyotr Petrovitch as
though comforted went back to clicking his beads.

Its all slander and nonsense! cried Lebeziatnikov who was always
afraid of allusions to the subject. It was not like that at all it
was quite different. Youve heard it wrong; its a libel. I was simply
defending myself. She rushed at me first with her nails she pulled
out all my whiskers.... Its permissable for anyone I should hope
to defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on
principle for its an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simply
pushed her back.

He-he-he! Luzhin went on laughing maliciously.

You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself.... But
thats nonsense and it has nothing nothing whatever to do with the
woman question! You dont understand; I used to think indeed that
if women are equal to men in all respects even in strength (as is
maintained now) there ought to be equality in that too. Of course I
reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise
for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is
unthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality
in fighting. I am not so stupid... though of course there is
fighting... there wont be later but at present there is... confound
it! How muddled one gets with you! Its not on that account that I
am not going. I am not going on principle not to take part in the
revolting convention of memorial dinners thats why! Though of course
one might go to laugh at it.... I am sorry there wont be any priests at
it. I should certainly go if there were.

Then you would sit down at another mans table and insult it and those
who invited you. Eh?

Certainly not insult but protest. I should do it with a good object. I
might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. Its
a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the
more harshly perhaps the better. I might drop a seed an idea.... And
something might grow up from that seed. How should I be insulting them?
They might be offended at first but afterwards theyd see Id done them
a service. You know Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed
because when she left her family and... devoted... herself she wrote to
her father and mother that she wouldnt go on living conventionally and
was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh
that she might have spared them and have written more kindly. I think
thats all nonsense and theres no need of softness; on the contrary
whats wanted is protest. Varents had been married seven years she
abandoned her two children she told her husband straight out in a
letter: I have realised that I cannot be happy with you. I can never
forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there
is another organisation of society by means of the communities. I have
only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given
myself and with whom I am establishing a community. I speak plainly
because I consider it dishonest to deceive you. Do as you think best.
Do not hope to get me back you are too late. I hope you will be happy.
Thats how letters like that ought to be written!

Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?

No its only the second really! But what if it were the fourth what
if it were the fifteenth thats all nonsense! And if ever I regretted
the death of my father and mother it is now and I sometimes think
if my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them! I
would have done something on purpose... I would have shown them! I would
have astonished them! I am really sorry there is no one!

To surprise! He-he! Well be that as you will Pyotr Petrovitch
interrupted but tell me this; do you know the dead mans daughter the
delicate-looking little thing? Its true what they say about her isnt
it?

What of it? I think that is it is my own personal conviction that
this is the normal condition of women. Why not? I mean _distinguons_.
In our present society it is not altogether normal because it is
compulsory but in the future society it will be perfectly normal
because it will be voluntary. Even as it is she was quite right: she
was suffering and that was her asset so to speak her capital which
she had a perfect right to dispose of. Of course in the future
society there will be no need of assets but her part will have another
significance rational and in harmony with her environment. As to Sofya
Semyonovna personally I regard her action as a vigorous protest against
the organisation of society and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice
indeed when I look at her!

I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.

Lebeziatnikov was enraged.

Thats another slander he yelled. It was not so at all! That was all
Katerina Ivanovnas invention for she did not understand! And I never
made love to Sofya Semyonovna! I was simply developing her entirely
disinterestedly trying to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was her
protest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!

Have you asked her to join your community?

You keep on laughing and very inappropriately allow me to tell
you. You dont understand! There is no such rle in a community. The
community is established that there should be no such rles. In a
community such a rle is essentially transformed and what is stupid
here is sensible there what under present conditions is unnatural
becomes perfectly natural in the community. It all depends on the
environment. Its all the environment and man himself is nothing. And
I am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day which is a proof
that she never regarded me as having wronged her. I am trying now to
attract her to the community but on quite quite a different footing.
What are you laughing at? We are trying to establish a community of
our own a special one on a broader basis. We have gone further in our
convictions. We reject more! And meanwhile Im still developing Sofya
Semyonovna. She has a beautiful beautiful character!

And you take advantage of her fine character eh? He-he!

No no! Oh no! On the contrary.

Oh on the contrary! He-he-he! A queer thing to say!

Believe me! Why should I disguise it? In fact I feel it strange myself
how timid chaste and modern she is with me!

And you of course are developing her... he-he! trying to prove to her
that all that modesty is nonsense?

Not at all not at all! How coarsely how stupidly--excuse me saying
so--you misunderstand the word development! Good heavens how... crude
you still are! We are striving for the freedom of women and you have
only one idea in your head.... Setting aside the general question
of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed
prejudices I fully accept her chastity with me because thats for her
to decide. Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me
I should think myself very lucky because I like the girl very much; but
as it is no one has ever treated her more courteously than I with more
respect for her dignity... I wait in hopes thats all!

You had much better make her a present of something. I bet you never
thought of that.

You dont understand as Ive told you already! Of course she is in
such a position but its another question. Quite another question!
You simply despise her. Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider
deserving of contempt you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow
creature. You dont know what a character she is! I am only sorry that
of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used
to lend them to her. I am sorry too that with all the energy and
resolution in protesting--which she has already shown once--she has
little self-reliance little so to say independence so as to
break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas. Yet she
thoroughly understands some questions for instance about kissing of
hands that is that its an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her
hand because its a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it and
I described it to her. She listened attentively to an account of the
workmens associations in France too. Now I am explaining the question
of coming into the room in the future society.

And whats that pray?

We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the community
the right to enter another members room whether man or woman at any
time... and we decided that he has!

It might be at an inconvenient moment he-he!

Lebeziatnikov was really angry.

You are always thinking of something unpleasant he cried with
aversion. Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system I
referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy! Its always
a stumbling-block to people like you they turn it into ridicule before
they understand it. And how proud they are of it too! Tfoo! Ive often
maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till
he has a firm faith in the system. And tell me please what do you
find so shameful even in cesspools? I should be the first to be ready
to clean out any cesspool you like. And its not a question of
self-sacrifice its simply work honourable useful work which is
as good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a
Pushkin because it is more useful.

And more honourable more honourable he-he-he!

What do you mean by more honourable? I dont understand such
expressions to describe human activity. More honourable nobler--all
those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is
_of use_ to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: _useful_!
You can snigger as much as you like but thats so!

Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished counting the money
and was putting it away. But some of the notes he left on the table. The
cesspool question had already been a subject of dispute between them.
What was absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry while it
amused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his
young friend.

Its your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured and
annoying blurted out Lebeziatnikov who in spite of his independence
 and his protests did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still
behaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years.

Youd better tell me this Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughty
displeasure can you... or rather are you really friendly enough with
that young person to ask her to step in here for a minute? I think
theyve all come back from the cemetery... I heard the sound of
steps... I want to see her that young person.

What for? Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.

Oh I want to. I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore I
wanted to speak to her about... However you may be present during the
interview. Its better you should be indeed. For theres no knowing
what you might imagine.

I shant imagine anything. I only asked and if youve anything to say
to her nothing is easier than to call her in. Ill go directly and you
may be sure I wont be in your way.

Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She came in very
much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual. She was always shy in
such circumstances and was always afraid of new people she had been as
a child and was even more so now.... Pyotr Petrovitch met her politely
and affably but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in
his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight
in dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ as she. He
hastened to reassure her and made her sit down facing him at the
table. Sonia sat down looked about her--at Lebeziatnikov at the notes
lying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eyes
remained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door. Pyotr
Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.

Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come? he asked him in a whisper.

Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes he is there. I saw him just come in....
Why?

Well I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave
me alone with this... young woman. I only want a few words with her
but God knows what they may make of it. I shouldnt like Raskolnikov to
repeat anything.... You understand what I mean?

I understand! Lebeziatnikov saw the point. Yes you are right.... Of
course I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy
but... still you are right. Certainly Ill stay. Ill stand here at the
window and not be in your way... I think you are right...

Pyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa sat down opposite Sonia looked
attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified even severe
expression as much as to say dont you make any mistake madam.
 Sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment.

In the first place Sofya Semyonovna will you make my excuses to your
respected mamma.... Thats right isnt it? Katerina Ivanovna stands
in the place of a mother to you? Pyotr Petrovitch began with great
dignity though affably.

It was evident that his intentions were friendly.

Quite so yes; the place of a mother Sonia answered timidly and
hurriedly.

Then will you make my apologies to her? Through inevitable
circumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in
spite of your mammas kind invitation.

Yes... Ill tell her... at once.

And Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.

Wait thats not all Pyotr Petrovitch detained her smiling at her
simplicity and ignorance of good manners and you know me little my
dear Sofya Semyonovna if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble
a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself
only. I have another object.

Sonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an instant on the
grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table but she
quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it
horribly indecorous especially for _her_ to look at another persons
money. She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held
in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a
yellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly she looked away and not
knowing where to turn ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight
in the face. After a pause of still greater dignity he continued.

I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with
Katerina Ivanovna poor woman. That was sufficient to enable me to
ascertain that she is in a position--preternatural if one may so
express it.

Yes... preternatural... Sonia hurriedly assented.

Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say ill.

Yes simpler and more comprehen... yes ill.

Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak
compassion I should be glad to be of service to her in any way
foreseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the whole of this
poverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?

Allow me to ask Sonia rose to her feet did you say something to her
yesterday of the possibility of a pension? Because she told me you had
undertaken to get her one. Was that true?

Not in the slightest and indeed its an absurdity! I merely hinted at
her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had
died in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently your
late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the
service at all of late. In fact if there could be any hope it would be
very ephemeral because there would be no claim for assistance in
that case far from it.... And she is dreaming of a pension already
he-he-he!... A go-ahead lady!

Yes she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted and she believes
everything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like
that... yes... You must excuse her said Sonia and again she got up to
go.

But you havent heard what I have to say.

No I havent heard muttered Sonia.

Then sit down. She was terribly confused; she sat down again a third
time.

Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones I should be glad
as I have said before so far as lies in my power to be of service
that is so far as is in my power not more. One might for instance get
up a subscription for her or a lottery something of the sort such as
is always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous
of assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; it might
be done.

Yes yes... God will repay you for it faltered Sonia gazing intently
at Pyotr Petrovitch.

It might be but we will talk of it later. We might begin it to-day we
will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak. Come
to me at seven oclock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov I hope will assist us. But
there is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and
for which I venture to trouble you Sofya Semyonovna to come here. In
my opinion money cannot be indeed its unsafe to put it into Katerina
Ivanovnas own hands. The dinner to-day is a proof of that. Though she
has not so to speak a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well boots
or shoes or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum and even
I believe Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through.
To-morrow it will all fall upon you again they wont have a crust of
bread. Its absurd really and so to my thinking a subscription ought
to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money but
only you for instance. Am I right?

I dont know... this is only to-day once in her life.... She was
so anxious to do honour to celebrate the memory.... And she is very
sensible... but just as you think and I shall be very very... they will
all be... and God will reward... and the orphans...

Sonia burst into tears.

Very well then keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the
benefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare from me
personally. I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in
connection with it. Here... having so to speak anxieties of my own I
cannot do more...

And Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully
unfolded. Sonia took it flushed crimson jumped up muttered something
and began taking leave. Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously
to the door. She got out of the room at last agitated and distressed
and returned to Katerina Ivanovna overwhelmed with confusion.

All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the
room anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he
walked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.

I heard and _saw_ everything he said laying stress on the last verb.
That is honourable I mean to say its humane! You wanted to avoid
gratitude I saw! And although I cannot I confess in principle
sympathise with private charity for it not only fails to eradicate the
evil but even promotes it yet I must admit that I saw your action with
pleasure--yes yes I like it.

Thats all nonsense muttered Pyotr Petrovitch somewhat disconcerted
looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.

No its not nonsense! A man who has suffered distress and annoyance as
you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others
such a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is still
deserving of respect! I did not expect it indeed of you Pyotr
Petrovitch especially as according to your ideas... oh what a drawback
your ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance by your
ill-luck yesterday cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov who felt
a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. And what do you want with
marriage with _legal_ marriage my dear noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why do
you cling to this _legality_ of marriage? Well you may beat me if you
like but I am glad positively glad it hasnt come off that you are
free that you are not quite lost for humanity.... you see Ive spoken
my mind!

Because I dont want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and
to bring up another mans children thats why I want legal marriage
 Luzhin replied in order to make some answer.

He seemed preoccupied by something.

Children? You referred to children Lebeziatnikov started off like
a warhorse at the trumpet call. Children are a social question and a
question of first importance I agree; but the question of children has
another solution. Some refuse to have children altogether because they
suggest the institution of the family. Well speak of children later
but now as to the question of honour I confess thats my weak point.
That horrid military Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the
dictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? Its nonsense
there will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural
consequence of a legal marriage so to say its corrective a protest.
So that indeed its not humiliating... and if I ever to suppose an
absurdity were to be legally married I should be positively glad of
it. I should say to my wife: My dear hitherto I have loved you now
I respect you for youve shown you can protest! You laugh! Thats
because you are incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound
it all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived
in a legal marriage but its simply a despicable consequence of a
despicable position in which both are humiliated. When the deception is
open as in a free marriage then it does not exist its unthinkable.
Your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you
incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for
her new husband. Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married
pfoo! I mean if I were to marry legally or not its just the same
I should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for
herself. My dear I should say I love you but even more than that I
desire you to respect me. See! Am I not right?

Pyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened but without much merriment.
He hardly heard it indeed. He was preoccupied with something else and
even Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited
and rubbed his hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected
upon it afterwards.



CHAPTER II

It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the
idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovnas disordered brain.
Nearly ten of the twenty roubles given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladovs
funeral were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to
honour the memory of the deceased suitably that all the lodgers
and still more Amalia Ivanovna might know that he was in no way their
inferior and perhaps very much their superior and that no one had the
right to turn up his nose at him. Perhaps the chief element was that
peculiar poor mans pride which compels many poor people to spend
their last savings on some traditional social ceremony simply in order
to do like other people and not to be looked down upon. It is very
probable too that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion at
the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone to show those
wretched contemptible lodgers that she knew how to do things how
to entertain and that she had been brought up in a genteel she might
almost say aristocratic colonels family and had not been meant for
sweeping floors and washing the childrens rags at night. Even the
poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these
paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible
nervous craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she
might have been killed by circumstance but her spirit could not have
been broken that is she could not have been intimidated her will
could not be crushed. Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her
mind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane but for a year
past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.
The later stages of consumption are apt doctors tell us to affect the
intellect.

There was no great variety of wines nor was there Madeira; but wine
there was. There was vodka rum and Lisbon wine all of the poorest
quality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice and
honey there were three or four dishes one of which consisted of
pancakes all prepared in Amalia Ivanovnas kitchen. Two samovars were
boiling that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Katerina
Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions with the help
of one of the lodgers an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been
stranded at Madame Lippevechsels. He promptly put himself at Katerina
Ivanovnas disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before
running about as fast as his legs could carry him and very anxious
that everyone should be aware of it. For every trifle he ran to Katerina
Ivanovna even hunting her out at the bazaar at every instant called
her _Pani_. She was heartily sick of him before the end though
she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this
serviceable and magnanimous man. It was one of Katerina Ivanovnas
characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.
Her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she
would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance
and quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she
would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the
person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. She
was naturally of a gay lively and peace-loving disposition but from
continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_
that all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the
peace that the slightest jar the smallest disaster reduced her almost
to frenzy and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and
fancies to cursing her fate and raving and knocking her head against
the wall.

Amalia Ivanovna too suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in
Katerina Ivanovnas eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary
respect probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart
and soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table
to provide the linen crockery etc. and to cook the dishes in her
kitchen and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone
herself to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even the
table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery knives forks and glasses
were of course of all shapes and patterns lent by different lodgers
but the table was properly laid at the time fixed and Amalia Ivanovna
feeling she had done her work well had put on a black silk dress and
a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some
pride. This pride though justifiable displeased Katerina Ivanovna for
some reason: as though the table could not have been laid except by
Amalia Ivanovna! She disliked the cap with new ribbons too. Could she
be stuck up the stupid German because she was mistress of the house
and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers! As a favour!
Fancy that! Katerina Ivanovnas father who had been a colonel and almost
a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons and then
anyone like Amalia Ivanovna or rather Ludwigovna would not have been
allowed into the kitchen.

Katerina Ivanovna however put off expressing her feelings for the
time and contented herself with treating her coldly though she decided
inwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down
and set her in her proper place for goodness only knew what she was
fancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that
hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral except
the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery while to the
memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned
up the wretched creatures many of them not quite sober. The older
and more respectable of them all as if by common consent stayed away.
Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin for instance who might be said to be the most
respectable of all the lodgers did not appear though Katerina Ivanovna
had the evening before told all the world that is Amalia Ivanovna
Polenka Sonia and the Pole that he was the most generous
noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections who had
been a friend of her first husbands and a guest in her fathers
house and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her
a considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna
exalted anyones connections and fortune it was without any ulterior
motive quite disinterestedly for the mere pleasure of adding to
the consequence of the person praised. Probably taking his cue from
Luzhin that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up
either. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindness
and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a
friend of his so that it would have been awkward not to invite him.

Among those who failed to appear were the genteel lady and her
old-maidish daughter who had only been lodgers in the house for the
last fortnight but had several times complained of the noise and uproar
in Katerina Ivanovnas room especially when Marmeladov had come
back drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who
quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna and threatening to turn the whole
family out of doors had shouted at her that they were not worth the
foot of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing. Katerina
Ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter whose
foot she was not worth and who had turned away haughtily when she
casually met them so that they might know that she was more noble in
her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice and might see
that she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to
make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late fathers
governorship and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly
stupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (he
was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent but it
appeared that he had been not himself for the last two days. The party
consisted of the Pole a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and
a greasy coat who had not a word to say for himself and smelt
abominably a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the
post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone
at Amalia Ivanovnas.

A retired clerk of the commissariat department came too; he was
drunk had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was without
a waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without
even greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit
appeared in his dressing-gown but this was too much and the efforts of
Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought
with him however two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovnas
and whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina
Ivanovna intensely. For whom had they made all these preparations
then? To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid
for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the
furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box while Polenka as a big
girl had to look after them feed them and keep their noses wiped like
well-bred childrens.

Katerina Ivanovna in fact could hardly help meeting her guests with
increased dignity and even haughtiness. She stared at some of them with
special severity and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushing
to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who
were absent she began treating her with extreme nonchalance which the
latter promptly observed and resented. Such a beginning was no good omen
for the end. All were seated at last.

Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the
cemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him in the
first place because he was the one educated visitor and as everyone
knew was in two years to take a professorship in the university and
secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having
been unable to be at the funeral. She positively pounced upon him and
made him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In
spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round
correctly and that everyone should taste them in spite of the agonising
cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse
during the last few days she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to
Raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at
the failure of the dinner interspersing her remarks with lively and
uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of
her landlady.

Its all that cuckoos fault! You know whom I mean? Her her! Katerina
Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady. Look at her shes making round
eyes she feels that we are talking about her and cant understand.
Pfoo the owl! Ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on that
cap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she wants everyone
to consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being
here? I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people especially
those who knew my late husband and look at the set of fools she has
brought! The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And those
wretched Poles ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) Not one of them has ever
poked his nose in here Ive never set eyes on them. What have they come
here for I ask you? There they sit in a row. Hey _pan_! she cried
suddenly to one of them have you tasted the pancakes? Take some more!
Have some beer! Wont you have some vodka? Look hes jumped up and is
making his bows they must be quite starved poor things. Never mind
let them eat! They dont make a noise anyway though Im really afraid
for our landladys silver spoons... Amalia Ivanovna! she addressed her
suddenly almost aloud if your spoons should happen to be stolen
I wont be responsible I warn you! Ha-ha-ha! She laughed turning to
Raskolnikov and again nodding towards the landlady in high glee at her
sally. She didnt understand she didnt understand again! Look how
she sits with her mouth open! An owl a real owl! An owl in new ribbons
ha-ha-ha!

Here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that
lasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead
and her handkerchief was stained with blood. She showed Raskolnikov
the blood in silence and as soon as she could get her breath began
whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her
cheeks.

Do you know I gave her the most delicate instructions so to speak
for inviting that lady and her daughter you understand of whom I am
speaking? It needed the utmost delicacy the greatest nicety but she
has managed things so that that fool that conceited baggage that
provincial nonentity simply because she is the widow of a major and
has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the
government offices because at fifty she paints her face (everybody
knows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come and has
not even answered the invitation which the most ordinary good manners
required! I cant understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But
wheres Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah there she is at last! what is it
Sonia where have you been? Its odd that even at your fathers funeral
you should be so unpunctual. Rodion Romanovitch make room for her
beside you. Thats your place Sonia... take what you like. Have some of
the cold entre with jelly thats the best. Theyll bring the pancakes
directly. Have they given the children some? Polenka have you got
everything? (Cough-cough-cough.) Thats all right. Be a good girl Lida
and Kolya dont fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman.
What are you saying Sonia?

Sonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitchs apologies trying to
speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most
respectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She added
that Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that as soon as
he possibly could he would come immediately to discuss _business_ alone
with her and to consider what could be done for her etc. etc.

Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna would flatter her
and gratify her pride. She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him a
hurried bow glancing curiously at him. But for the rest of the time
she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed
absent-minded though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna trying
to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get
mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown and Katerina Ivanovna had on her
only dress a dark striped cotton one.

The message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. Listening to
Sonia with dignity Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how
Pyotr Petrovitch was then at once whispered almost aloud to
Raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of
Pyotr Petrovitchs position and standing to find himself in such
extraordinary company in spite of his devotion to her family and his
old friendship with her father.

Thats why I am so grateful to you Rodion Romanovitch that you have
not disdained my hospitality even in such surroundings she added
almost aloud. But I am sure that it was only your special affection for
my poor husband that has made you keep your promise.

Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors and
suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: Wouldnt he
have some more meat and had he been given some wine? The old man made
no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked
though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him. He
simply gazed about him with his mouth open which only increased the
general mirth.

What an imbecile! Look look! Why was he brought? But as to Pyotr
Petrovitch I always had confidence in him Katerina Ivanovna
continued and of course he is not like... with an extremely stern
face she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter
was quite disconcerted not like your dressed up draggletails whom
my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen and my late
husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the
goodness of his heart.

Yes he was fond of drink he was fond of it he did drink! cried the
commissariat clerk gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka.

My late husband certainly had that weakness and everyone knows
it Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once but he was a kind and
honourable man who loved and respected his family. The worst of it was
his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people and he
drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you
believe it Rodion Romanovitch they found a gingerbread cock in his
pocket; he was dead drunk but he did not forget the children!

A cock? Did you say a cock? shouted the commissariat clerk.

Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed lost in
thought.

No doubt you think like everyone that I was too severe with him she
went on addressing Raskolnikov. But thats not so! He respected me he
respected me very much! He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was
for him sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me I used to
feel so sorry for him I used to want to be kind to him and then would
think to myself: Be kind to him and he will drink again it was only
by severity that you could keep him within bounds.

Yes he used to get his hair pulled pretty often roared the
commissariat clerk again swallowing another glass of vodka.

Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing as well as having
their hair pulled. I am not talking of my late husband now! Katerina
Ivanovna snapped at him.

The flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked her chest heaved. In
another minute she would have been ready to make a scene. Many of the
visitors were sniggering evidently delighted. They began poking the
commissariat clerk and whispering something to him. They were evidently
trying to egg him on.

Allow me to ask what are you alluding to began the clerk that is
to say whose... about whom... did you say just now... But I dont care!
Thats nonsense! Widow! I forgive you.... Pass!

And he took another drink of vodka.

Raskolnikov sat in silence listening with disgust. He only ate from
politeness just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually
putting on his plate to avoid hurting her feelings. He watched Sonia
intently. But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she
too foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably and saw with
terror Katerina Ivanovnas growing irritation. She knew that she Sonia
was the chief reason for the genteel ladies contemptuous treatment of
Katerina Ivanovnas invitation. She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that
the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the
question: How could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young
person_? Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard
this and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an
insult to herself her children or her father Sonia knew that
Katerina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now till she had shown those
draggletails that they were both... To make matters worse someone
passed Sonia from the other end of the table a plate with two hearts
pierced with an arrow cut out of black bread. Katerina Ivanovna flushed
crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it
was a drunken ass!

Amalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss and at the same time
deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovnas haughtiness and to restore the
good-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began
apropos of nothing telling a story about an acquaintance of hers Karl
from the chemists who was driving one night in a cab and that the
cabman wanted him to kill and Karl very much begged him not to kill
and wept and clasped hands and frightened and from fear pierced his
heart. Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled she observed at once that
Amalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was
still more offended and she retorted that her _Vater aus Berlin_ was a
very important man and always went with his hands in pockets. Katerina
Ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia
Ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.

Listen to the owl! Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once her
good-humour almost restored she meant to say he kept his hands in
his pockets but she said he put his hands in peoples pockets.
(Cough-cough.) And have you noticed Rodion Romanovitch that all these
Petersburg foreigners the Germans especially are all stupider than
we! Can you fancy anyone of us telling how Karl from the chemists
pierced his heart from fear and that the idiot instead of punishing
the cabman clasped his hands and wept and much begged. Ah the fool!
And you know she fancies its very touching and does not suspect how
stupid she is! To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great
deal cleverer anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with
drink but you know these foreigners are always so well behaved
and serious.... Look how she sits glaring! She is angry ha-ha!
(Cough-cough-cough.)

Regaining her good-humour Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling
Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension she intended to open
a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----.
This was the first time she had spoken to him of the project and she
launched out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that
Katerina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of
which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern when he told
him that Katerina Ivanovna his wife had danced the shawl dance
before the governor and other great personages on leaving school. This
certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina
Ivanovnas right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself
with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming those two stuck-up
draggletails if they came to the dinner and proving incontestably
that Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble she might even say
aristocratic family a colonels daughter and was far superior to
certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late. The
certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken
guests and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it for it actually
contained the statement _en toutes lettres_ that her father was of the
rank of a major and also a companion of an order so that she really
was almost the daughter of a colonel.

Warming up Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and
happy life they would lead in T---- on the gymnasium teachers whom
she would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school one a most
respectable old Frenchman one Mangot who had taught Katerina Ivanovna
herself in old days and was still living in T---- and would no doubt
teach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who would
go with her to T---- and help her in all her plans. At this someone at
the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.

Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of
it she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of
Sonias undoubted ability to assist her of her gentleness patience
devotion generosity and good education tapping Sonia on the cheek and
kissing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson and Katerina Ivanovna
suddenly burst into tears immediately observing that she was nervous
and silly that she was too much upset that it was time to finish and
as the dinner was over it was time to hand round the tea.

At that moment Amalia Ivanovna deeply aggrieved at taking no part in
the conversation and not being listened to made one last effort
and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty
observation that in the future boarding-school she would have to pay
particular attention to _die Wsche_ and that there certainly must be a
good _dame_ to look after the linen and secondly that the young ladies
must not novels at night read.

Katerina Ivanovna who certainly was upset and very tired as well as
heartily sick of the dinner at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna saying
she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense that it was the
business of the laundry maid and not of the directress of a high-class
boarding-school to look after _die Wsche_ and as for novel-reading
that was simply rudeness and she begged her to be silent. Amalia
Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only meant her
good and that she had meant her very good and that it was long
since she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings.

Katerina Ivanovna at once set her down saying that it was a lie to
say she wished her good because only yesterday when her dead husband
was lying on the table she had worried her about the lodgings. To this
Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those
ladies but those ladies had not come because those ladies _are_
ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady. Katerina Ivanovna
at once pointed out to her that as she was a slut she could not judge
what made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her
_Vater aus Berlin_ was a very very important man and both hands in
pockets went and always used to say: Poof! poof! and she leapt
up from the table to represent her father sticking her hands in her
pockets puffing her cheeks and uttering vague sounds resembling poof!
poof! amid loud laughter from all the lodgers who purposely encouraged
Amalia Ivanovna hoping for a fight.

But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna and she at once declared
so that all could hear that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a
father but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn and had certainly once
been a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red
as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a
father but she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat
and always said poof-poof-poof!

Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family
was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print
that her father was a colonel while Amalia Ivanovnas father--if she
really had one--was probably some Finnish milkman but that probably she
never had a father at all since it was still uncertain whether her name
was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.

At this Amalia Ivanovna lashed to fury struck the table with her fist
and shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna and not Ludwigovna that
her _Vater_ was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister and that
Katerina Ivanovnas _Vater_ was quite never a burgomeister. Katerina
Ivanovna rose from her chair and with a stern and apparently calm voice
(though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that if she
dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a
level with her papa she Katerina Ivanovna would tear her cap off her
head and trample it under foot. Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room
shouting at the top of her voice that she was mistress of the house and
that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she
rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.
There was a great outcry and uproar the children began crying. Sonia
ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted
something about the yellow ticket Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia
away and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.

At that minute the door opened and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared
on the threshold. He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant
eyes. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.



CHAPTER III

Pyotr Petrovitch she cried protect me... you at least! Make this
foolish woman understand that she cant behave like this to a lady in
misfortune... that there is a law for such things.... Ill go to the
governor-general himself.... She shall answer for it.... Remembering my
fathers hospitality protect these orphans.

Allow me madam.... Allow me. Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off. Your
papa as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing (someone
laughed aloud) and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting
squabbles with Amalia Ivanovna.... I have come here to speak of my own
affairs... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter Sofya...
Ivanovna I think it is? Allow me to pass.

Pyotr Petrovitch edging by her went to the opposite corner where Sonia
was.

Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she was as though
thunderstruck. She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny
having enjoyed her fathers hospitality. Though she had invented it
herself she believed in it firmly by this time. She was struck too
by the businesslike dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr
Petrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance. Not
only was this serious business man strikingly incongruous with the
rest of the party but it was evident too that he had come upon some
matter of consequence that some exceptional cause must have brought him
and that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov standing
beside Sonia moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not
seem to notice him. A minute later Lebeziatnikov too appeared in the
doorway; he did not come in but stood still listening with marked
interest almost wonder and seemed for a time perplexed.

Excuse me for possibly interrupting you but its a matter of
some importance Pyotr Petrovitch observed addressing the company
generally. I am glad indeed to find other persons present. Amalia
Ivanovna I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful
attention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna
 he went on addressing Sonia who was very much surprised and already
alarmed immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble
note was missing from my table in the room of my friend Mr.
Lebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where
it is now I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to
witness that the matter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be
compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must
blame yourself.

Complete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children were
still. Sonia stood deadly pale staring at Luzhin and unable to say a
word. She seemed not to understand. Some seconds passed.

Well how is it to be then? asked Luzhin looking intently at her.

I dont know.... I know nothing about it Sonia articulated faintly at
last.

No you know nothing? Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some
seconds. Think a moment mademoiselle he began severely but still
as it were admonishing her. Reflect I am prepared to give you time
for consideration. Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely
convinced I should not you may be sure with my experience venture to
accuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accusation before
witnesses if false or even mistaken I should myself in a certain sense
be made responsible I am aware of that. This morning I changed for
my own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of
approximately three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my
pocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr.
Lebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three
hundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.
About five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three
notes of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at my
invitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedingly
embarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the
conversation and tried to make off. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness
to this. You yourself mademoiselle probably will not refuse to confirm
my statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov solely in
order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your
relative Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend)
and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a
subscription lottery or the like for her benefit. You thanked me and
even shed tears. I describe all this as it took place primarily to
recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest
detail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten-rouble note from
the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part
for the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then
I accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of
embarrassment--after which being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I
talked to him for ten minutes--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I
returned to the table with the money lying on it intending to count
it and to put it aside as I proposed doing before. To my surprise one
hundred-rouble note had disappeared. Kindly consider the position.
Mr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such
a supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning for the
minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found the
total correct. You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment your
eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some
time on the table and taking into consideration your social position
and the habits associated with it I was so to say with horror and
positively against my will _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a
cruel but justifiable suspicion! I will add further and repeat that in
spite of my positive conviction I realise that I run a certain risk in
making this accusation but as you see I could not let it pass. I have
taken action and I will tell you why: solely madam solely owing
to your black ingratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your
destitute relative I present you with my donation of ten roubles and
you on the spot repay me for all that with such an action. It is too
bad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover like a true friend I beg
you--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you
are doing otherwise I shall be immovable! Well what do you say?

I have taken nothing Sonia whispered in terror you gave me ten
roubles here it is take it.

Sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket untied a corner of it
took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin.

And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking? he insisted
reproachfully not taking the note.

Sonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such awful stern
ironical hostile eyes. She looked at Raskolnikov... he stood against
the wall with his arms crossed looking at her with glowing eyes.

Good God! broke from Sonia.

Amalia Ivanovna we shall have to send word to the police and therefore
I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter Luzhin said
softly and even kindly.

_Gott der Barmherzige_! I knew she was the thief cried Amalia
Ivanovna throwing up her hands.

You knew it? Luzhin caught her up then I suppose you had some reason
before this for thinking so. I beg you worthy Amalia Ivanovna to
remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses.

There was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All were in
movement.

What! cried Katerina Ivanovna suddenly realising the position and
she rushed at Luzhin. What! You accuse her of stealing? Sonia? Ah the
wretches the wretches!

And running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as
in a vise.

Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish girl! Give it
to me! Give me the ten roubles at once--here!

And snatching the note from Sonia Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and
flung it straight into Luzhins face. It hit him in the eye and fell
on the ground. Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch
lost his temper.

Hold that mad woman! he shouted.

At that moment several other persons besides Lebeziatnikov appeared in
the doorway among them the two ladies.

What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot! shrieked Katerina Ivanovna. You are an
idiot yourself pettifogging lawyer base man! Sonia Sonia take his
money! Sonia a thief! Why shed give away her last penny! and Katerina
Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter. Did you ever see such an
idiot? she turned from side to side. And you too? she suddenly saw
the landlady and you too sausage eater you declare that she is a
thief you trashy Prussian hens leg in a crinoline! She hasnt been
out of this room: she came straight from you you wretch and sat down
beside me everyone saw her. She sat here by Rodion Romanovitch. Search
her! Since shes not left the room the money would have to be on her!
Search her search her! But if you dont find it then excuse me my
dear fellow youll answer for it! Ill go to our Sovereign to our
Sovereign to our gracious Tsar himself and throw myself at his feet
to-day this minute! I am alone in the world! They would let me in! Do
you think they wouldnt? Youre wrong I will get in! I will get in!
You reckoned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not so
submissive let me tell you! Youve gone too far yourself. Search her
search her!

And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards
Sonia.

I am ready Ill be responsible... but calm yourself madam calm
yourself. I see that you are not so submissive!... Well well but as to
that... Luzhin muttered that ought to be before the police... though
indeed there are witnesses enough as it is.... I am ready.... But in
any case its difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... But with
the help of Amalia Ivanovna... though of course its not the way to do
things.... How is it to be done?

As you will! Let anyone who likes search her! cried Katerina Ivanovna.
Sonia turn out your pockets! See! Look monster the pocket is empty
here was her handkerchief! Here is the other pocket look! Dyou see
dyou see?

And Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside
out. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing
a parabola in the air fell at Luzhins feet. Everyone saw it several
cried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down picked up the paper in two
fingers lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a
hundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note
showing it to everyone.

Thief! Out of my lodging. Police police! yelled Amalia Ivanovna.
They must to Siberia be sent! Away!

Exclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent keeping his
eyes fixed on Sonia except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.
Sonia stood still as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feel
surprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry
and hid her face in her hands.

No it wasnt I! I didnt take it! I know nothing about it she cried
with a heartrending wail and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna who clasped
her tightly in her arms as though she would shelter her from all the
world.

Sonia! Sonia! I dont believe it! You see I dont believe it! she
cried in the face of the obvious fact swaying her to and fro in her
arms like a baby kissing her face continually then snatching at her
hands and kissing them too you took it! How stupid these people are!
Oh dear! You are fools fools she cried addressing the whole room
you dont know you dont know what a heart she has what a girl she
is! She take it she? Shed sell her last rag shed go barefoot to help
you if you needed it thats what she is! She has the yellow passport
because my children were starving she sold herself for us! Ah husband
husband! Do you see? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for you!
Merciful heavens! Defend her why are you all standing still? Rodion
Romanovitch why dont you stand up for her? Do you believe it too? You
are not worth her little finger all of you together! Good God! Defend
her now at least!

The wail of the poor consumptive helpless woman seemed to produce a
great effect on her audience. The agonised wasted consumptive face
the parched blood-stained lips the hoarse voice the tears unrestrained
as a childs the trustful childish and yet despairing prayer for help
were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petrovitch
at any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.

Madam madam this incident does not reflect upon you! he cried
impressively no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an
instigator or even an accomplice in it especially as you have proved
her guilt by turning out her pockets showing that you had no previous
idea of it. I am most ready most ready to show compassion if poverty
so to speak drove Sofya Semyonovna to it but why did you refuse to
confess mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step?
You lost your head perhaps? One can quite understand it.... But how
could you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen he
addressed the whole company gentlemen! Compassionate and so to say
commiserating these people I am ready to overlook it even now in spite
of the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be a
lesson to you for the future he said addressing Sonia and I will
carry the matter no further. Enough!

Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met and the
fire in Raskolnikovs seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. Meanwhile
Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging
Sonia like a madwoman. The children too were embracing Sonia on
all sides and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what was
wrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs as she hid her pretty
little face swollen with weeping on Sonias shoulder.

How vile! a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.

Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.

What vileness! Lebeziatnikov repeated staring him straight in the
face.

Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it
afterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.

And you dared to call me as witness? he said going up to Pyotr
Petrovitch.

What do you mean? What are you talking about? muttered Luzhin.

I mean that you... are a slanderer thats what my words mean!
 Lebeziatnikov said hotly looking sternly at him with his short-sighted
eyes.

He was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him as though
seizing and weighing each word. Again there was a silence. Pyotr
Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.

If you mean that for me... he began stammering. But whats the
matter with you? Are you out of your mind?

Im in my mind but you are a scoundrel! Ah how vile! I have heard
everything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it for I must own
even now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I
cant understand.

Why what have I done then? Give over talking in your nonsensical
riddles! Or maybe you are drunk!

You may be a drunkard perhaps vile man but I am not! I never touch
vodka for its against my convictions. Would you believe it he he
himself with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble
note--I saw it I was a witness Ill take my oath! He did it he!
 repeated Lebeziatnikov addressing all.

Are you crazy milksop? squealed Luzhin. She is herself before
you--she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her
only ten roubles. How could I have given it to her?

I saw it I saw it Lebeziatnikov repeated and though it is against
my principles I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like
before the court for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Only
like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying
good-bye to her at the door while you held her hand in one hand with
the other the left you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it I
saw it!

Luzhin turned pale.

What lies! he cried impudently why how could you standing by the
window see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes. You
are raving!

No I didnt fancy it. And though I was standing some way off I saw
it all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from
the window--thats true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble
note because when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles
you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I
was standing near then and an idea struck me at once so that I did not
forget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your hand
all the time. I didnt think of it again until when you were getting
up you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped
it! I noticed it because the same idea struck me again that you meant
to do her a kindness without my seeing. You can fancy how I watched you
and I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket. I saw it I
saw it Ill take my oath.

Lebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose on all hands
chiefly expressive of wonder but some were menacing in tone. They all
crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.

I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one to take her
part! She is an orphan. God has sent you!

Katerina Ivanovna hardly knowing what she was doing sank on her knees
before him.

A pack of nonsense! yelled Luzhin roused to fury its all nonsense
youve been talking! An idea struck you you didnt think you
noticed--what does it amount to? So I gave it to her on the sly on
purpose? What for? With what object? What have I to do with this...?

What for? Thats what I cant understand but that what I am telling
you is the fact thats certain! So far from my being mistaken you
infamous criminal man I remember how on account of it a question
occurred to me at once just when I was thanking you and pressing
your hand. What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did it
secretly I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from me knowing that
my convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private
benevolence which effects no radical cure? Well I decided that you
really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps
too I thought he wants to give her a surprise when she finds a whole
hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know some benevolent people
are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) Then
the idea struck me too that you wanted to test her to see whether
when she found it she would come to thank you. Then too that you
wanted to avoid thanks and that as the saying is your right hand
should not know... something of that sort in fact. I thought of so
many possibilities that I put off considering it but still thought it
indelicate to show you that I knew your secret. But another idea struck
me again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she
noticed it that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of
the room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.
But on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikovs to take them the
General Treatise on the Positive Method and especially to recommend
Piderits article (and also Wagners); then I come on here and what a
state of things I find! Now could I could I have all these ideas and
reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her
pocket?

When Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical
deduction at the end he was quite tired and the perspiration streamed
from his face. He could not alas even express himself correctly
in Russian though he knew no other language so that he was quite
exhausted almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech
produced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such vehemence with such
conviction that everyone obviously believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt
that things were going badly with him.

What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you? he shouted
thats no evidence. You may have dreamt it thats all! And I tell you
you are lying sir. You are lying and slandering from some spite against
me simply from pique because I did not agree with your free-thinking
godless social propositions!

But this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Murmurs of disapproval
were heard on all sides.

Ah thats your line now is it! cried Lebeziatnikov thats
nonsense! Call the police and Ill take my oath! Theres only one thing
I cant understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action. Oh
pitiful despicable man!

I can explain why he risked such an action and if necessary I too
will swear to it Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice and he
stepped forward.

He appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt clearly from the
very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would
be solved.

Now I can explain it all to myself said Raskolnikov addressing
Lebeziatnikov. From the very beginning of the business I suspected
that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it. I began
to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only which
I will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your
valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all
all to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recently
engaged to be married to a young lady--my sister Avdotya Romanovna
Raskolnikov. But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me the day
before yesterday at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room--I
have two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man.... The day
before yesterday I did not know that he was staying here in your room
and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before
yesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral
as a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note to
my mother and informed her that I had given away all my money not
to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna and referred in a most
contemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna that is
hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you
understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister
by insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money
which they had sent me and which was all they had. Yesterday evening
before my mother and sister and in his presence I declared that I had
given the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya
Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had
never seen her before indeed. At the same time I added that he
Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin with all his virtues was not worth Sofya
Semyonovnas little finger though he spoke so ill of her. To his
question--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister I
answered that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother
and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations he
gradually began being unpardonably rude to them. A final rupture took
place and he was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday
evening. Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now
succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief he would
have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his
suspicions that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on
a level with Sofya Semyonovna that in attacking me he was protecting
and preserving the honour of my sister his betrothed. In fact he might
even through all this have been able to estrange me from my family
and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing
of revenging himself on me personally for he has grounds for supposing
that the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to
me. That was what he was working for! Thats how I understand it. Thats
the whole reason for it and there can be no other!

It was like this or somewhat like this that Raskolnikov wound up his
speech which was followed very attentively though often interrupted by
exclamations from his audience. But in spite of interruptions he spoke
clearly calmly exactly firmly. His decisive voice his tone of
conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.

Yes yes thats it Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully that must be
it for he asked me as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room
whether you were here whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovnas
guests. He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was
essential for him that you should be here! Thats it thats it!

Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. He
seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape. Perhaps he would have
been glad to give up everything and get away but at the moment this
was scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth of
the accusations brought against him. Moreover the company which had
already been excited by drink was now too much stirred to allow it. The
commissariat clerk though indeed he had not grasped the whole position
was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very
unpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came
in from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excited
and were continually shouting at him: The _pan_ is a _lajdak_! and
muttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strained
attention though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as
though she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take her
eyes off Raskolnikov feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina
Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.
Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone with her mouth
wide open unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr
Petrovitch had somehow come to grief.

Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again but they did not let him.
Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.
But Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of
Sonia had completely failed he had recourse to insolence:

Allow me gentlemen allow me! Dont squeeze let me pass! he said
making his way through the crowd. And no threats if you please! I
assure you it will be useless you will gain nothing by it. On the
contrary youll have to answer gentlemen for violently obstructing
the course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked and I
shall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk and
will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels agitators and
atheists who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are
foolish enough to admit.... Yes allow me to pass!

Dont let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave at once and
everything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble Ive
been taking the way Ive been expounding... all this fortnight!

I told you myself to-day that I was going when you tried to keep me;
now I will simply add that you are a fool. I advise you to see a doctor
for your brains and your short sight. Let me pass gentlemen!

He forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to
let him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table brandished
it in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew
straight at Amalia Ivanovna. She screamed and the clerk overbalancing
fell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room
and half an hour later had left the house. Sonia timid by nature had
felt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than
anyone and that she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till that
moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care
gentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her disappointment was
too great. She could of course bear with patience and almost without
murmur anything even this. But for the first minute she felt it too
bitter. In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first
terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all
clearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her
made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical
weeping. At last unable to bear any more she rushed out of the room
and ran home almost immediately after Luzhins departure. When amidst
loud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna it was more than the
landlady could endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina
Ivanovna considering her to blame for everything.

Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!

And with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay
her hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna and throwing it on the
floor. Katerina Ivanovna pale almost fainting and gasping for breath
jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at
Amalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her
away like a feather.

What! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature
attacks me! What! On the day of my husbands funeral I am turned out of
my lodging! After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street
with my orphans! Where am I to go? wailed the poor woman sobbing and
gasping. Good God! she cried with flashing eyes is there no justice
upon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see!
There is law and justice on earth there is I will find it! Wait a bit
godless creature! Polenka stay with the children Ill come back. Wait
for me if you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is
justice on earth!

And throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had
mentioned to Raskolnikov Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the
disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room and
wailing and tearful she ran into the street--with a vague intention
of going at once somewhere to find justice. Polenka with the two little
ones in her arms crouched terrified on the trunk in the corner of the
room where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia
Ivanovna raged about the room shrieking lamenting and throwing
everything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked
incoherently some commented to the best of their ability on what had
happened others quarrelled and swore at one another while others
struck up a song....

Now its time for me to go thought Raskolnikov. Well Sofya
Semyonovna we shall see what youll say now!

And he set off in the direction of Sonias lodgings.



CHAPTER IV

Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against
Luzhin although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own
heart. But having gone through so much in the morning he found a sort
of relief in a change of sensations apart from the strong personal
feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too
especially at some moments by the thought of his approaching interview
with Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the
terrible suffering it would be to him and as it were brushed away the
thought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovnas Well
Sofya Semyonovna we shall see what youll say now! he was still
superficially excited still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over
Luzhin. But strange to say by the time he reached Sonias lodging he
felt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at the
door asking himself the strange question: Must he tell her who killed
Lizaveta? It was a strange question because he felt at the very time
not only that he could not help telling her but also that he could
not put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so he
only _felt_ it and the agonising sense of his impotence before
the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and
suffering he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the
doorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in
her hands but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet
him as though she were expecting him.

What would have become of me but for you? she said quickly meeting
him in the middle of the room.

Evidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what she had been
waiting for.

Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she
had only just risen. She stood facing him two steps away just as she
had done the day before.

Well Sonia? he said and felt that his voice was trembling it was
all due to your social position and the habits associated with it. Did
you understand that just now?

Her face showed her distress.

Only dont talk to me as you did yesterday she interrupted him.
Please dont begin it. There is misery enough without that.

She made haste to smile afraid that he might not like the reproach.

I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I
wanted to go back directly but I kept thinking that... you would come.

He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging
and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere to seek justice.

My God! cried Sonia lets go at once....

And she snatched up her cape.

Its everlastingly the same thing! said Raskolnikov irritably.
Youve no thought except for them! Stay a little with me.

But... Katerina Ivanovna?

You wont lose Katerina Ivanovna you may be sure shell come to you
herself since she has run out he added peevishly. If she doesnt find
you here youll be blamed for it....

Sonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent gazing at
the floor and deliberating.

This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you he began not looking
at Sonia but if he had wanted to if it had suited his plans he would
have sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.
Ah?

Yes she assented in a faint voice. Yes she repeated preoccupied
and distressed.

But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accident
Lebeziatnikovs turning up.

Sonia was silent.

And if youd gone to prison what then? Do you remember what I said
yesterday?

Again she did not answer. He waited.

I thought you would cry out again dont speak of it leave off.
 Raskolnikov gave a laugh but rather a forced one. What silence
again? he asked a minute later. We must talk about something you
know. It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a
certain problem as Lebeziatnikov would say. (He was beginning to lose
the thread.) No really I am serious. Imagine Sonia that you had
known all Luzhins intentions beforehand. Known that is for a fact
that they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and
yourself thrown in--since you dont count yourself for anything--Polenka
too... for shell go the same way. Well if suddenly it all depended on
your decision whether he or they should go on living that is whether
Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things or Katerina Ivanovna
should die? How would you decide which of them was to die? I ask you?

Sonia looked uneasily at him. There was something peculiar in this
hesitating question which seemed approaching something in a roundabout
way.

I felt that you were going to ask some question like that she said
looking inquisitively at him.

I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?

Why do you ask about what could not happen? said Sonia reluctantly.

Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked
things? You havent dared to decide even that!

But I cant know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what
cant be answered? Whats the use of such foolish questions? How could
it happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge
to decide who is to live and who is not to live?

Oh if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it there is no doing
anything Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.

Youd better say straight out what you want! Sonia cried in distress.
You are leading up to something again.... Can you have come simply to
torture me?

She could not control herself and began crying bitterly. He looked at
her in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.

Of course youre right Sonia he said softly at last. He was suddenly
changed. His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.
Even his voice was suddenly weak. I told you yesterday that I was not
coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing Ive said is to ask
forgiveness.... I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.
I was asking forgiveness Sonia....

He tried to smile but there was something helpless and incomplete in
his pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.

And suddenly a strange surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred
for Sonia passed through his heart. As it were wondering and frightened
of this sensation he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he
met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was
love in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real
feeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant that
_that_ minute had come.

He hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. Suddenly he
turned pale got up from his chair looked at Sonia and without
uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed.

His sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had
stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that he must
not lose another minute.

Whats the matter? asked Sonia dreadfully frightened.

He could not utter a word. This was not at all not at all the way he
had intended to tell and he did not understand what was happening to
him now. She went up to him softly sat down on the bed beside him and
waited not taking her eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It
was unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked
helplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed
through Sonias heart.

Whats the matter? she repeated drawing a little away from him.

Nothing Sonia dont be frightened.... Its nonsense. It really is
nonsense if you think of it he muttered like a man in delirium. Why
have I come to torture you? he added suddenly looking at her. Why
really? I keep asking myself that question Sonia....

He had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour
before but now he spoke helplessly hardly knowing what he said and
feeling a continual tremor all over.

Oh how you are suffering! she muttered in distress looking intently
at him.

Its all nonsense.... Listen Sonia. He suddenly smiled a pale
helpless smile for two seconds. You remember what I meant to tell you
yesterday?

Sonia waited uneasily.

I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever but
that if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta.

She began trembling all over.

Well here Ive come to tell you.

Then you really meant it yesterday? she whispered with difficulty.
How do you know? she asked quickly as though suddenly regaining her
reason.

Sonias face grew paler and paler and she breathed painfully.

I know.

She paused a minute.

Have they found him? she asked timidly.

No.

Then how do you know about _it_? she asked again hardly audibly and
again after a minutes pause.

He turned to her and looked very intently at her.

Guess he said with the same distorted helpless smile.

A shudder passed over her.

But you... why do you frighten me like this? she said smiling like a
child.

I must be a great friend of _his_... since I know Raskolnikov went
on still gazing into her face as though he could not turn his eyes
away. He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her
accidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and
he went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too.

Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.

You cant guess then? he asked suddenly feeling as though he were
flinging himself down from a steeple.

N-no... whispered Sonia.

Take a good look.

As soon as he had said this again the same familiar sensation froze his
heart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the
face of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizavetas
face when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the
wall putting out her hand with childish terror in her face looking
as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something
looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them shrinking back and
holding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same
thing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same
terror she looked at him for a while and suddenly putting out her left
hand pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to
get up from the bed moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed
even more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear
showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost
with the same _childish_ smile.

Have you guessed? he whispered at last.

Good God! broke in an awful wail from her bosom.

She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows but a
moment later she got up moved quickly to him seized both his hands
and gripping them tight in her thin fingers began looking into his
face again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she
tried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;
there was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on indeed when
she recalled that moment she thought it strange and wondered why she
had seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said for
instance that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now as
soon as he told her she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen
this very thing.

Stop Sonia enough! dont torture me he begged her miserably.

It was not at all not at all like this he had thought of telling her
but this is how it happened.

She jumped up seeming not to know what she was doing and wringing her
hands walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat
down again beside him her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden
she started as though she had been stabbed uttered a cry and fell on
her knees before him she did not know why.

What have you done--what have you done to yourself? she said in
despair and jumping up she flung herself on his neck threw her arms
round him and held him tightly.

Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.

You are a strange girl Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you
about that.... You dont think what you are doing.

There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you! she
cried in a frenzy not hearing what he said and she suddenly broke into
violent hysterical weeping.

A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at
once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes
and hung on his eyelashes.

Then you wont leave me Sonia? he said looking at her almost with
hope.

No no never nowhere! cried Sonia. I will follow you I will follow
you everywhere. Oh my God! Oh how miserable I am!... Why why didnt I
know you before! Why didnt you come before? Oh dear!

Here I have come.

Yes now! Whats to be done now?... Together together! she repeated
as it were unconsciously and she hugged him again. Ill follow you to
Siberia!

He recoiled at this and the same hostile almost haughty smile came to
his lips.

Perhaps I dont want to go to Siberia yet Sonia he said.

Sonia looked at him quickly.

Again after her first passionate agonising sympathy for the unhappy man
the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone she
seemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She
knew nothing as yet why how with what object it had been. Now all
these questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could not
believe it: He he is a murderer! Could it be true?

Whats the meaning of it? Where am I? she said in complete
bewilderment as though still unable to recover herself. How could you
you a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does
it mean?

Oh well--to plunder. Leave off Sonia he answered wearily almost
with vexation.

Sonia stood as though struck dumb but suddenly she cried:

You were hungry! It was... to help your mother? Yes?

No Sonia no he muttered turning away and hanging his head. I was
not so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother but... thats
not the real thing either.... Dont torture me Sonia.

Sonia clasped her hands.

Could it could it all be true? Good God what a truth! Who could
believe it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet
rob and murder! Ah she cried suddenly that money you gave Katerina
Ivanovna... that money.... Can that money...

No Sonia he broke in hurriedly that money was not it. Dont worry
yourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill the
day I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....
That money was mine--my own.

Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.

And _that_ money.... I dont even know really whether there was any
money he added softly as though reflecting. I took a purse off her
neck made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...
but I didnt look in it; I suppose I hadnt time.... And the
things--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next
morning in a yard off the V---- Prospect. They are all there now....

Sonia strained every nerve to listen.

Then why... why you said you did it to rob but you took nothing? she
asked quickly catching at a straw.

I dont know.... I havent yet decided whether to take that money or
not he said musing again; and seeming to wake up with a start he
gave a brief ironical smile. Ach what silly stuff I am talking eh?

The thought flashed through Sonias mind wasnt he mad? But she
dismissed it at once. No it was something else. She could make
nothing of it nothing.

Do you know Sonia he said suddenly with conviction let me tell
you: if Id simply killed because I was hungry laying stress on
every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her I should
be _happy_ now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you he
cried a moment later with a sort of despair what would it matter to
you if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such
a stupid triumph over me? Ah Sonia was it for that Ive come to you
to-day?

Again Sonia tried to say something but did not speak.

I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.

Go where? asked Sonia timidly.

Not to steal and not to murder dont be anxious he smiled bitterly.
We are so different.... And you know Sonia its only now only this
moment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!
Yesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for one
thing I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You wont leave me
Sonia?

She squeezed his hand.

And why why did I tell her? Why did I let her know? he cried a minute
later in despair looking with infinite anguish at her. Here you expect
an explanation from me Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it I see
that. But what can I tell you? You wont understand and will only suffer
misery... on my account! Well you are crying and embracing me again.
Why do you do it? Because I couldnt bear my burden and have come to
throw it on another: you suffer too and I shall feel better! And can
you love such a mean wretch?

But arent you suffering too? cried Sonia.

Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart and again for an
instant softened it.

Sonia I have a bad heart take note of that. It may explain a great
deal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldnt have
come. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! Thats
not the point. I must speak now but I dont know how to begin.

He paused and sank into thought.

Ach we are so different he cried again we are not alike. And why
why did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.

No no it was a good thing you came cried Sonia. Its better I
should know far better!

He looked at her with anguish.

What if it were really that? he said as though reaching a conclusion.
Yes thats what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon that is why I
killed her.... Do you understand now?

N-no Sonia whispered navely and timidly. Only speak speak I shall
understand I shall understand _in myself_! she kept begging him.

Youll understand? Very well we shall see! He paused and was for some
time lost in meditation.

It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if
Napoleon for instance had happened to be in my place and if he had
not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his
career with but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things
there had simply been some ridiculous old hag a pawnbroker who had
to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career you
understand). Well would he have brought himself to that if there had
been no other means? Wouldnt he have felt a pang at its being so far
from monumental and... and sinful too? Well I must tell you that I
worried myself fearfully over that question so that I was awfully
ashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden somehow) that it would
not have given him the least pang that it would not even have struck
him that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there
was anything in it to pause over and that if he had had no other way
he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!
Well I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her following
his example. And thats exactly how it was! Do you think it funny? Yes
Sonia the funniest thing of all is that perhaps thats just how it
was.

Sonia did not think it at all funny.

You had better tell me straight out... without examples she begged
still more timidly and scarcely audibly.

He turned to her looked sadly at her and took her hands.

You are right again Sonia. Of course thats all nonsense its almost
all talk! You see you know of course that my mother has scarcely
anything my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned
to drudge as a governess. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a
student but I couldnt keep myself at the university and was forced
for a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that in ten
or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or
clerk with a salary of a thousand roubles (he repeated it as though it
were a lesson) and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief
and anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my
sister... well my sister might well have fared worse! And its a hard
thing to pass everything by all ones life to turn ones back upon
everything to forget ones mother and decorously accept the insults
inflicted on ones sister. Why should one? When one has buried them to
burden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again
without a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old womans
money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother
to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving
it--and to do this all on a broad thorough scale so as to build up
a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....
Well... thats all.... Well of course in killing the old woman I did
wrong.... Well thats enough.

He struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head
sink.

Oh thats not it thats not it Sonia cried in distress. How could
one... no thats not right not right.

You see yourself that its not right. But Ive spoken truly its the
truth.

As though that could be the truth! Good God!

Ive only killed a louse Sonia a useless loathsome harmful
creature.

A human being--a louse!

I too know it wasnt a louse he answered looking strangely at
her. But I am talking nonsense Sonia he added. Ive been talking
nonsense a long time.... Thats not it you are right there. There were
quite quite other causes for it! I havent talked to anyone for so
long Sonia.... My head aches dreadfully now.

His eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost delirious; an
uneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible exhaustion could be seen
through his excitement. Sonia saw how he was suffering. She too
was growing dizzy. And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow
comprehensible but yet... But how how! Good God! And she wrung her
hands in despair.

No Sonia thats not it he began again suddenly raising his head
as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were
roused him--thats not it! Better... imagine--yes its certainly
better--imagine that I am vain envious malicious base vindictive
and... well perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Lets have it all out
at once! Theyve talked of madness already I noticed.) I told you just
now I could not keep myself at the university. But do you know that
perhaps I might have done? My mother would have sent me what I needed
for the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes boots and food
no doubt. Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! But I
turned sulky and wouldnt. (Yes sulkiness thats the right word for
it!) I sat in my room like a spider. Youve been in my den youve seen
it.... And do you know Sonia that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp
the soul and the mind? Ah how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldnt
go out of it! I wouldnt on purpose! I didnt go out for days together
and I wouldnt work I wouldnt even eat I just lay there doing
nothing. If Nastasya brought me anything I ate it if she didnt I
went all day without; I wouldnt ask on purpose from sulkiness! At
night I had no light I lay in the dark and I wouldnt earn money for
candles. I ought to have studied but I sold my books; and the dust lies
an inch thick on the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and
thinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time strange
dreams of all sorts no need to describe! Only then I began to fancy
that... No thats not it! Again I am telling you wrong! You see I kept
asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I
know they are--yet I wont be wiser? Then I saw Sonia that if one
waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards I
understood that that would never come to pass that men wont change and
that nobody can alter it and that its not worth wasting effort over it.
Yes thats so. Thats the law of their nature Sonia... thats so!...
And I know now Sonia that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will
have power over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their
eyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he
who dares most of all will be most in the right! So it has been till now
and so it will always be. A man must be blind not to see it!

Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this he no longer cared
whether she understood or not. The fever had complete hold of him; he
was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without
talking to anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his
faith and code.

I divined then Sonia he went on eagerly that power is only
vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only
one thing one thing needful: one has only to dare! Then for the first
time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever
thought of before me no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is
that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to
go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I... I wanted
_to have the daring_... and I killed her. I only wanted to have the
daring Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!

Oh hush hush cried Sonia clasping her hands. You turned away from
God and God has smitten you has given you over to the devil!

Then Sonia when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became
clear to me was it a temptation of the devil eh?

Hush dont laugh blasphemer! You dont understand you dont
understand! Oh God! He wont understand!

Hush Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it was the devil
leading me. Hush Sonia hush! he repeated with gloomy insistence. I
know it all I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all
over to myself lying there in the dark.... Ive argued it all over with
myself every point of it and I know it all all! And how sick how
sick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it
and make a new beginning Sonia and leave off thinking. And you dont
suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a
wise man and that was just my destruction. And you mustnt suppose that
I didnt know for instance that if I began to question myself whether
I had the right to gain power--I certainly hadnt the right--or that if
I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasnt
so for me though it might be for a man who would go straight to his
goal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days
wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not I felt clearly
of course that I wasnt Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that
battle of ideas Sonia and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder
without casuistry to murder for my own sake for myself alone! I didnt
want to lie about it even to myself. It wasnt to help my mother I did
the murder--thats nonsense--I didnt do the murder to gain wealth and
power and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it;
I did the murder for myself for myself alone and whether I became a
benefactor to others or spent my life like a spider catching men in
my web and sucking the life out of men I couldnt have cared at that
moment.... And it was not the money I wanted Sonia when I did it. It
was not so much the money I wanted but something else.... I know it all
now.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder
again. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led
me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse
like everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or
not whether I dare stoop to pick up or not whether I am a trembling
creature or whether I have the _right_...

To kill? Have the right to kill? Sonia clasped her hands.

Ach Sonia! he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort
but was contemptuously silent. Dont interrupt me Sonia. I want to
prove one thing only that the devil led me on then and he has shown me
since that I had not the right to take that path because I am just such
a louse as all the rest. He was mocking me and here Ive come to you
now! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse should I have come to
you? Listen: when I went then to the old womans I only went to
_try_.... You may be sure of that!

And you murdered her!

But how did I murder her? Is that how men do murders? Do men go to
commit a murder as I went then? I will tell you some day how I went!
Did I murder the old woman? I murdered myself not her! I crushed myself
once for all for ever.... But it was the devil that killed that old
woman not I. Enough enough Sonia enough! Let me be! he cried in a
sudden spasm of agony let me be!

He leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as
in a vise.

What suffering! A wail of anguish broke from Sonia.

Well what am I to do now? he asked suddenly raising his head and
looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair.

What are you to do? she cried jumping up and her eyes that had been
full of tears suddenly began to shine. Stand up! (She seized him by
the shoulder he got up looking at her almost bewildered.) Go at once
this very minute stand at the cross-roads bow down first kiss the
earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say
to all men aloud I am a murderer! Then God will send you life again.
Will you go will you go? she asked him trembling all over snatching
his two hands squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes
full of fire.

He was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.

You mean Siberia Sonia? I must give myself up? he asked gloomily.

Suffer and expiate your sin by it thats what you must do.

No! I am not going to them Sonia!

But how will you go on living? What will you live for? cried Sonia
how is it possible now? Why how can you talk to your mother? (Oh what
will become of them now?) But what am I saying? You have abandoned your
mother and your sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh
God! she cried why he knows it all himself. How how can he live by
himself! What will become of you now?

Dont be a child Sonia he said softly. What wrong have I done
them? Why should I go to them? What should I say to them? Thats only a
phantom.... They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a
virtue. They are knaves and scoundrels Sonia! I am not going to them.
And what should I say to them--that I murdered her but did not dare to
take the money and hid it under a stone? he added with a bitter smile.
Why they would laugh at me and would call me a fool for not getting
it. A coward and a fool! They wouldnt understand and they dont deserve
to understand. Why should I go to them? I wont. Dont be a child
Sonia....

It will be too much for you to bear too much! she repeated holding
out her hands in despairing supplication.

Perhaps Ive been unfair to myself he observed gloomily pondering
perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse and Ive been in too great
a hurry to condemn myself. Ill make another fight for it.

A haughty smile appeared on his lips.

What a burden to bear! And your whole life your whole life!

I shall get used to it he said grimly and thoughtfully. Listen he
began a minute later stop crying its time to talk of the facts: Ive
come to tell you that the police are after me on my track....

Ach! Sonia cried in terror.

Well why do you cry out? You want me to go to Siberia and now you are
frightened? But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up. I shall
make a struggle for it and they wont do anything to me. Theyve no real
evidence. Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but
to-day things are going better. All the facts they know can be explained
two ways thats to say I can turn their accusations to my credit do
you understand? And I shall for Ive learnt my lesson. But they will
certainly arrest me. If it had not been for something that happened
they would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will
arrest me to-day.... But thats no matter Sonia; theyll let me out
again... for there isnt any real proof against me and there wont be
I give you my word for it. And they cant convict a man on what they
have against me. Enough.... I only tell you that you may know.... I will
try to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they
wont be frightened.... My sisters future is secure however now I
believe... and my mothers must be too.... Well thats all. Be careful
though. Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?

Oh I will I will.

They sat side by side both mournful and dejected as though they had
been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore. He looked at
Sonia and felt how great was her love for him and strange to say he
felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved. Yes it was a
strange and awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that
all his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least part
of his suffering and now when all her heart turned towards him he
suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before.

Sonia he said youd better not come and see me when I am in
prison.

Sonia did not answer she was crying. Several minutes passed.

Have you a cross on you? she asked as though suddenly thinking of it.

He did not at first understand the question.

No of course not. Here take this one of cypress wood. I have
another a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I changed with
Lizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon. I will
wear Lizavetas now and give you this. Take it... its mine! Its mine
you know she begged him. We will go to suffer together and together
we will bear our cross!

Give it me said Raskolnikov.

He did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he drew back the
hand he held out for the cross.

Not now Sonia. Better later he added to comfort her.

Yes yes better she repeated with conviction when you go to meet
your suffering then put it on. You will come to me Ill put it on you
we will pray and go together.

At that moment someone knocked three times at the door.

Sofya Semyonovna may I come in? they heard in a very familiar and
polite voice.

Sonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of Mr.
Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door.



CHAPTER V

Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed.

Ive come to you Sofya Semyonovna he began. Excuse me... I thought
I should find you he said addressing Raskolnikov suddenly that is
I didnt mean anything... of that sort... But I just thought... Katerina
Ivanovna has gone out of her mind he blurted out suddenly turning
from Raskolnikov to Sonia.

Sonia screamed.

At least it seems so. But... we dont know what to do you see! She
came back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere perhaps
beaten.... So it seems at least... She had run to your fathers former
chief she didnt find him at home: he was dining at some other
generals.... Only fancy she rushed off there to the other generals
and imagine she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to
see her had him fetched out from dinner it seems. You can imagine what
happened. She was turned out of course; but according to her own
story she abused him and threw something at him. One may well believe
it.... How it is she wasnt taken up I cant understand! Now she is
telling everyone including Amalia Ivanovna; but its difficult to
understand her she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes
she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her she will take the
children and go into the street with a barrel-organ and the children
will sing and dance and she too and collect money and will go every
day under the generals window... to let everyone see well-born
children whose father was an official begging in the street. She
keeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida
to sing My Village the boy to dance Polenka the same. She is tearing
up all the clothes and making them little caps like actors; she means
to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle instead of music.... She wont
listen to anything.... Imagine the state of things! Its beyond
anything!

Lebeziatnikov would have gone on but Sonia who had heard him almost
breathless snatched up her cloak and hat and ran out of the room
putting on her things as she went. Raskolnikov followed her and
Lebeziatnikov came after him.

She has certainly gone mad! he said to Raskolnikov as they went out
into the street. I didnt want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna so I said
it seemed like it but there isnt a doubt of it. They say that in
consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; its a pity I
know nothing of medicine. I did try to persuade her but she wouldnt
listen.

Did you talk to her about the tubercles?

Not precisely of the tubercles. Besides she wouldnt have understood!
But what I say is that if you convince a person logically that he
has nothing to cry about hell stop crying. Thats clear. Is it your
conviction that he wont?

Life would be too easy if it were so answered Raskolnikov.

Excuse me excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for
Katerina Ivanovna to understand but do you know that in Paris they have
been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the
insane simply by logical argument? One professor there a scientific
man of standing lately dead believed in the possibility of such
treatment. His idea was that theres nothing really wrong with the
physical organism of the insane and that insanity is so to say a
logical mistake an error of judgment an incorrect view of things. He
gradually showed the madman his error and would you believe it they
say he was successful? But as he made use of douches too how far
success was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... So it seems at
least.

Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the house where he
lived he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate. Lebeziatnikov
woke up with a start looked about him and hurried on.

Raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle
of it. Why had he come back here? He looked at the yellow and tattered
paper at the dust at his sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuous
knocking; someone seemed to be hammering... He went to the window rose
on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of
absorbed attention. But the yard was empty and he could not see who was
hammering. In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the
window-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out
of the windows... He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat down
on the sofa.

Never never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!

Yes he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia now
that he had made her more miserable.

Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need had he to poison
her life? Oh the meanness of it!

I will remain alone he said resolutely and she shall not come to
the prison!

Five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. That was a
strange thought.

Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia he thought suddenly.

He could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging
through his mind. All at once the door opened and Dounia came in. At
first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway just as he
had done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place
as yesterday on the chair facing him. He looked silently and almost
vacantly at her.

Dont be angry brother; Ive only come for one minute said Dounia.

Her face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were bright and soft.
He saw that she too had come to him with love.

Brother now I know all _all_. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and
told me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through a
stupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that
there is no danger and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such
horror. I dont think so and I fully understand how indignant you must
be and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. Thats
what I am afraid of. As for your cutting yourself off from us I dont
judge you I dont venture to judge you and forgive me for having
blamed you for it. I feel that I too if I had so great a trouble
should keep away from everyone. I shall tell mother nothing _of this_
but I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that
you will come very soon. Dont worry about her; _I_ will set her mind at
rest; but dont you try her too much--come once at least; remember that
she is your mother. And now I have come simply to say (Dounia began
to get up) that if you should need me or should need... all my life or
anything... call me and Ill come. Good-bye!

She turned abruptly and went towards the door.

Dounia! Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. That Razumihin
Dmitri Prokofitch is a very good fellow.

Dounia flushed slightly.

Well? she asked waiting a moment.

He is competent hardworking honest and capable of real love....
Good-bye Dounia.

Dounia flushed crimson then suddenly she took alarm.

But what does it mean brother? Are we really parting for ever that
you... give me such a parting message?

Never mind.... Good-bye.

He turned away and walked to the window. She stood a moment looked at
him uneasily and went out troubled.

No he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very last one)
when he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her
and even _to tell_ her but he had not dared even to touch her hand.

Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her and
will feel that I stole her kiss.

And would _she_ stand that test? he went on a few minutes later to
himself. No she wouldnt; girls like that cant stand things! They
never do.

And he thought of Sonia.

There was a breath of fresh air from the window. The daylight was
fading. He took up his cap and went out.

He could not of course and would not consider how ill he was. But all
this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him. And
if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this
continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession
of his faculties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.

He wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery had
begun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant nothing acute
about it; but there was a feeling of permanence of eternity about it;
it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery a
foretaste of an eternity on a square yard of space. Towards evening
this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.

With this idiotic purely physical weakness depending on the sunset or
something one cant help doing something stupid! Youll go to Dounia
as well as to Sonia he muttered bitterly.

He heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziatnikov rushed up to
him.

Only fancy Ive been to your room looking for you. Only fancy shes
carried out her plan and taken away the children. Sofya Semyonovna and
I have had a job to find them. She is rapping on a frying-pan and making
the children dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the
cross-roads and in front of shops; theres a crowd of fools running
after them. Come along!

And Sonia? Raskolnikov asked anxiously hurrying after Lebeziatnikov.

Simply frantic. That is its not Sofya Semyonovnas frantic but
Katerina Ivanovna though Sofya Semyonovas frantic too. But Katerina
Ivanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you she is quite mad. Theyll be
taken to the police. You can fancy what an effect that will have....
They are on the canal bank near the bridge now not far from Sofya
Semyonovnas quite close.

On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one
where Sonia lodged there was a crowd of people consisting principally
of gutter children. The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could
be heard from the bridge and it certainly was a strange spectacle
likely to attract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress
with the green shawl wearing a torn straw hat crushed in a hideous way
on one side was really frantic. She was exhausted and breathless. Her
wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever and indeed out
of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.
But her excitement did not flag and every moment her irritation grew
more intense. She rushed at the children shouted at them coaxed
them told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing began
explaining to them why it was necessary and driven to desperation by
their not understanding beat them.... Then she would make a rush at the
crowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look she
immediately appealed to him to see what these children from a genteel
one may say aristocratic house had been brought to. If she heard
laughter or jeering in the crowd she would rush at once at the scoffers
and begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed others shook their
heads but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the
frightened children. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken
was not there at least Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead of
rapping on the pan Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands
when she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in
the singing but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough
which made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her most
furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had
been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed. The
boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.
There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap
or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov decorated with
a broken piece of white ostrich feather which had been Katerina
Ivanovnas grandmothers and had been preserved as a family possession.
Polenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her
mother and kept at her side hiding her tears. She dimly realised her
mothers condition and looked uneasily about her. She was terribly
frightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina
Ivanovna weeping and beseeching her to return home but Katerina
Ivanovna was not to be persuaded.

Leave off Sonia leave off she shouted speaking fast panting and
coughing. You dont know what you ask; you are like a child! Ive
told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Let
everyone let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets
though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in
truth and fidelity and one may say died in the service. (Katerina
Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly
believed it.) Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly
Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough I
wont go on so! Ah Rodion Romanovitch is that you? she cried seeing
Raskolnikov and rushing up to him. Explain to this silly girl please
that nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn their
living and everyone will see at once that we are different that we are
an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that general
will lose his post youll see! We shall perform under his windows every
day and if the Tsar drives by Ill fall on my knees put the children
before me show them to him and say Defend us father. He is the
father of the fatherless he is merciful hell protect us youll
see and that wretch of a general.... Lida _tenez vous droite_! Kolya
youll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! What
are you afraid of stupid? Goodness what am I to do with them Rodion
Romanovitch? If you only knew how stupid they are! Whats one to do with
such children?

And she almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted
rapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children. Raskolnikov tried
to persuade her to go home and even said hoping to work on her vanity
that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like
an organ-grinder as she was intending to become the principal of a
boarding-school.

A boarding-school ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air cried Katerina
Ivanovna her laugh ending in a cough. No Rodion Romanovitch that
dream is over! All have forsaken us!... And that general.... You know
Rodion Romanovitch I threw an inkpot at him--it happened to be standing
in the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. I wrote my
name threw it at him and ran away. Oh the scoundrels the scoundrels!
But enough of them now Ill provide for the children myself I wont
bow down to anybody! She has had to bear enough for us! she pointed
to Sonia. Polenka how much have you got? Show me! What only two
farthings! Oh the mean wretches! They give us nothing only run after
us putting their tongues out. There what is that blockhead laughing
at? (She pointed to a man in the crowd.) Its all because Kolya here
is so stupid; I have such a bother with him. What do you want Polenka?
Tell me in French _parlez-moi franais_. Why Ive taught you you know
some phrases. Else how are you to show that you are of good family well
brought-up children and not at all like other organ-grinders? We arent
going to have a Punch and Judy show in the street but to sing a genteel
song.... Ah yes... What are we to sing? You keep putting me out
but we... you see we are standing here Rodion Romanovitch to find
something to sing and get money something Kolya can dance to.... For
as you can fancy our performance is all impromptu.... We must talk it
over and rehearse it all thoroughly and then we shall go to Nevsky
where there are far more people of good society and we shall be noticed
at once. Lida knows My Village only nothing but My Village and
everyone sings that. We must sing something far more genteel.... Well
have you thought of anything Polenka? If only youd help your mother!
My memorys quite gone or I should have thought of something. We really
cant sing An Hussar. Ah let us sing in French Cinq sous I have
taught it you I have taught it you. And as it is in French people will
see at once that you are children of good family and that will be much
more touching.... You might sing Marlborough sen va-t-en guerre
for thats quite a childs song and is sung as a lullaby in all the
aristocratic houses.

_Marlborough sen va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra_...
 she began singing. But no better sing Cinq sous. Now Kolya your
hands on your hips make haste and you Lida keep turning the other
way and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!

_Cinq sous cinq sous Pour monter notre menage_.

(Cough-cough-cough!) Set your dress straight Polenka its slipped
down on your shoulders she observed panting from coughing. Now its
particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly that all may
see that you are well-born children. I said at the time that the bodice
should be cut longer and made of two widths. It was your fault Sonia
with your advice to make it shorter and now you see the child is quite
deformed by it.... Why youre all crying again! Whats the matter
stupids? Come Kolya begin. Make haste make haste! Oh what an
unbearable child!

Cinq sous cinq sous.

A policeman again! What do you want?

A policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd. But at that
moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking
official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted
Katerina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached and
without a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His face wore
a look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a
polite even ceremonious bow.

I thank you honoured sir she began loftily. The causes that have
induced us (take the money Polenka: you see there are generous and
honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress).
You see honoured sir these orphans of good family--I might even say of
aristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eating
grouse... and stamped at my disturbing him. Your excellency I said
protect the orphans for you knew my late husband Semyon Zaharovitch
and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his
only daughter.... That policeman again! Protect me she cried to the
official. Why is that policeman edging up to me? We have only just run
away from one of them. What do you want fool?

Its forbidden in the streets. You mustnt make a disturbance.

Its youre making a disturbance. Its just the same as if I were
grinding an organ. What business is it of yours?

You have to get a licence for an organ and you havent got one and in
that way you collect a crowd. Where do you lodge?

What a license? wailed Katerina Ivanovna. I buried my husband
to-day. What need of a license?

Calm yourself madam calm yourself began the official. Come along;
I will escort you.... This is no place for you in the crowd. You are
ill.

Honoured sir honoured sir you dont know screamed Katerina
Ivanovna. We are going to the Nevsky.... Sonia Sonia! Where is she?
She is crying too! Whats the matter with you all? Kolya Lida where
are you going? she cried suddenly in alarm. Oh silly children! Kolya
Lida where are they off to?...

Kolya and Lida scared out of their wits by the crowd and their
mothers mad pranks suddenly seized each other by the hand and ran off
at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.
Weeping and wailing poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was
a piteous and unseemly spectacle as she ran weeping and panting for
breath. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.

Bring them back bring them back Sonia! Oh stupid ungrateful
children!... Polenka! catch them.... Its for your sakes I...

She stumbled as she ran and fell down.

Shes cut herself shes bleeding! Oh dear! cried Sonia bending over
her.

All ran up and crowded around. Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the
first at her side the official too hastened up and behind him the
policeman who muttered Bother! with a gesture of impatience feeling
that the job was going to be a troublesome one.

Pass on! Pass on! he said to the crowd that pressed forward.

Shes dying someone shouted.

Shes gone out of her mind said another.

Lord have mercy upon us said a woman crossing herself. Have they
caught the little girl and the boy? Theyre being brought back the
elder ones got them.... Ah the naughty imps!

When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully they saw that she had
not cut herself against a stone as Sonia thought but that the blood
that stained the pavement red was from her chest.

Ive seen that before muttered the official to Raskolnikov and
Lebeziatnikov; thats consumption; the blood flows and chokes the
patient. I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago...
nearly a pint of blood all in a minute.... Whats to be done though?
She is dying.

This way this way to my room! Sonia implored. I live here!... See
that house the second from here.... Come to me make haste she turned
from one to the other. Send for the doctor! Oh dear!

Thanks to the officials efforts this plan was adopted the policeman
even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonias
room almost unconscious and laid on the bed. The blood was still
flowing but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov
Lebeziatnikov and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were
followed by the policeman who first drove back the crowd which followed
to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida who
were trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the
Kapernaumovs room; the landlord a lame one-eyed man of strange
appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush his
wife a woman with an everlastingly scared expression and several
open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these
Svidrigalov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him
with surprise not understanding where he had come from and not having
noticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The
official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now
for the doctor but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran
himself.

Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceased
for a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at
Sonia who stood pale and trembling wiping the sweat from her brow with
a handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the
bed supporting her on both sides.

Where are the children? she said in a faint voice. Youve brought
them Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run away.... Och!

Once more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes
looking about her.

So thats how you live Sonia! Never once have I been in your room.

She looked at her with a face of suffering.

We have been your ruin Sonia. Polenka Lida Kolya come here! Well
here they are Sonia take them all! I hand them over to you Ive had
enough! The ball is over. (Cough!) Lay me down let me die in peace.

They laid her back on the pillow.

What the priest? I dont want him. You havent got a rouble to spare.
I have no sins. God must forgive me without that. He knows how I have
suffered.... And if He wont forgive me I dont care!

She sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered
turned her eyes from side to side recognised everyone for a minute
but at once sank into delirium again. Her breathing was hoarse and
difficult there was a sort of rattle in her throat.

I said to him your excellency she ejaculated gasping after each
word. That Amalia Ludwigovna ah! Lida Kolya hands on your hips
make haste! _Glissez glissez! pas de basque!_ Tap with your heels be a
graceful child!

_Du hast Diamanten und Perlen_

What next? Thats the thing to sing.

_Du hast die schnsten Augen Mdchen was willst du mehr?_

What an idea! _Was willst du mehr?_ What things the fool invents! Ah
yes!

In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.

Ah how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction Polenka! Your
father you know used to sing it when we were engaged.... Oh those
days! Oh thats the thing for us to sing! How does it go? Ive
forgotten. Remind me! How was it?

She was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last in a horribly
hoarse broken voice she began shrieking and gasping at every word
with a look of growing terror.

In the heat of midday!... in the vale!... of Dagestan!... With lead in
my breast!...

Your excellency! she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and
a flood of tears protect the orphans! You have been their fathers
guest... one may say aristocratic.... She started regaining
consciousness and gazed at all with a sort of terror but at once
recognised Sonia.

Sonia Sonia! she articulated softly and caressingly as though
surprised to find her there. Sonia darling are you here too?

They lifted her up again.

Enough! Its over! Farewell poor thing! I am done for! I am broken!
 she cried with vindictive despair and her head fell heavily back on the
pillow.

She sank into unconsciousness again but this time it did not last long.
Her pale yellow wasted face dropped back her mouth fell open her leg
moved convulsively she gave a deep deep sigh and died.

Sonia fell upon her flung her arms about her and remained motionless
with her head pressed to the dead womans wasted bosom. Polenka threw
herself at her mothers feet kissing them and weeping violently. Though
Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened they had a feeling
that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each others
little shoulders stared straight at one another and both at once opened
their mouths and began screaming. They were both still in their fancy
dress; one in a turban the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.

And how did the certificate of merit come to be on the bed beside
Katerina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.

He walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.

She is dead he said.

Rodion Romanovitch I must have two words with you said Svidrigalov
coming up to them.

Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.
Svidrigalov drew Raskolnikov further away.

I will undertake all the arrangements the funeral and that. You know
its a question of money and as I told you I have plenty to spare. I
will put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum
and I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming
of age so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. And I
will pull her out of the mud too for she is a good girl isnt she? So
tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand.

What is your motive for such benevolence? asked Raskolnikov.

Ah! you sceptical person! laughed Svidrigalov. I told you I had no
need of that money. Wont you admit that its simply done from humanity?
She wasnt a louse you know (he pointed to the corner where the
dead woman lay) was she like some old pawnbroker woman? Come youll
agree is Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked things or is she to
die? And if I didnt help them Polenka would go the same way.

He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness keeping his
eyes fixed on Raskolnikov who turned white and cold hearing his own
phrases spoken to Sonia. He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at
Svidrigalov.

How do you know? he whispered hardly able to breathe.

Why I lodge here at Madame Resslichs the other side of the wall.
Here is Kapernaumov and there lives Madame Resslich an old and devoted
friend of mine. I am a neighbour.

You?

Yes continued Svidrigalov shaking with laughter. I assure you
on my honour dear Rodion Romanovitch that you have interested me
enormously. I told you we should become friends I foretold it. Well
here we have. And you will see what an accommodating person I am. Youll
see that you can get on with me!




PART VI



CHAPTER I

A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had
fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there
was no escape. Recalling that period long after he believed that his
mind had been clouded at times and that it had continued so with
intervals till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been
mistaken about many things at that time for instance as to the date
of certain events. Anyway when he tried later on to piece his
recollections together he learnt a great deal about himself from what
other people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained
events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. At
times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness amounting sometimes
to panic. But he remembered too moments hours perhaps whole days
of complete apathy which came upon him as a reaction from his previous
terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility sometimes
seen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape
from a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential
facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome
to him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares the
neglect of which would have threatened him with complete inevitable
ruin.

He was particularly worried about Svidrigalov he might be said to be
permanently thinking of Svidrigalov. From the time of Svidrigalovs
too menacing and unmistakable words in Sonias room at the moment of
Katerina Ivanovnas death the normal working of his mind seemed to
break down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness
Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times finding
himself in a solitary and remote part of the town in some wretched
eating-house sitting alone lost in thought hardly knowing how he had
come there he suddenly thought of Svidrigalov. He recognised
suddenly clearly and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an
understanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking
outside the city gates one day he positively fancied that they had
fixed a meeting there that he was waiting for Svidrigalov. Another
time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes
and could not at first understand how he had come there.

But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovnas death he
had two or three times met Svidrigalov at Sonias lodging where he
had gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no
reference to the vital subject as though they were tacitly agreed not
to speak of it for a time.

Katerina Ivanovnas body was still lying in the coffin Svidrigalov was
busy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At
their last meeting Svidrigalov informed Raskolnikov that he had made
an arrangement and a very satisfactory one for Katerina Ivanovnas
children; that he had through certain connections succeeded in getting
hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at
once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled
on them had been of great assistance as it is much easier to place
orphans with some property than destitute ones. He said something
too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see
Raskolnikov mentioning that he would like to consult with him that
there were things they must talk over....

This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. Svidrigalov
looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly after a brief pause
dropping his voice asked: But how is it Rodion Romanovitch; you
dont seem yourself? You look and you listen but you dont seem to
understand. Cheer up! Well talk things over; I am only sorry Ive
so much to do of my own business and other peoples. Ah Rodion
Romanovitch he added suddenly what all men need is fresh air fresh
air... more than anything!

He moved to one side to make way for the priest and server who
were coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. By
Svidrigalovs orders it was sung twice a day punctually. Svidrigalov
went his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment thought and followed
the priest into Sonias room. He stood at the door. They began quietly
slowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the
thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive
and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem
service. And there was something else here as well too awful and
disturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the
coffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed softly and as it
were timidly weeping.

These last two days she hasnt said a word to me she hasnt glanced at
me Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the room;
the incense rose in clouds; the priest read Give rest oh Lord....
 Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and
took his leave the priest looked round strangely. After the service
Raskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her
head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered
Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of
repugnance no trace of disgust no tremor in her hand. It was the
furthest limit of self-abnegation at least so he interpreted it.

Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt
very miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude he
would have thought himself lucky even if he had to spend his whole life
there. But although he had almost always been by himself of late he had
never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to
the high road once he had even reached a little wood but the lonelier
the place was the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near
him. It did not frighten him but greatly annoyed him so that he
made haste to return to the town to mingle with the crowd to enter
restaurants and taverns to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt
easier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour
listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively
enjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again
as though his conscience smote him. Here I sit listening to singing
is that what I ought to be doing? he thought. Yet he felt at once
that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something
requiring immediate decision but it was something he could not clearly
understand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. No better the
struggle again! Better Porfiry again... or Svidrigalov.... Better some
challenge again... some attack. Yes yes! he thought. He went out of
the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and
his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke
up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island trembling
all over with fever; he walked home and it was early morning when he
arrived. After some hours sleep the fever left him but he woke up
late two oclock in the afternoon.

He remembered that Katerina Ivanovnas funeral had been fixed for that
day and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him
some food; he ate and drank with appetite almost with greediness. His
head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three
days. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.

The door opened and Razumihin came in.

Ah hes eating then hes not ill said Razumihin. He took a chair
and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.

He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident
annoyance but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as though
he had some special fixed determination.

Listen he began resolutely. As far as I am concerned you may all go
to hell but from what I see its clear to me that I cant make head or
tail of it; please dont think Ive come to ask you questions. I dont
want to know hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets I dare say
I shouldnt stay to listen I should go away cursing. I have only come
to find out once for all whether its a fact that you are mad? There is
a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit
Ive been disposed to that opinion myself judging from your stupid
repulsive and quite inexplicable actions and from your recent behavior
to your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them
as you have; so you must be mad.

When did you see them last?

Just now. Havent you seen them since then? What have you been doing
with yourself? Tell me please. Ive been to you three times already.
Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. She had made up
her mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she
wouldnt hear a word. If he is ill if his mind is giving way who can
look after him like his mother? she said. We all came here together we
couldnt let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.
We came in you werent here; she sat down and stayed ten minutes
while we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: If hes
gone out that is if he is well and has forgotten his mother its
humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for
kindness. She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.
I see she said that he has time for _his girl_. She means by _your
girl_ Sofya Semyonovna your betrothed or your mistress I dont know. I
went at once to Sofya Semyonovnas for I wanted to know what was going
on. I looked round I saw the coffin the children crying and
Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I
apologised came away and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So thats all
nonsense and you havent got a girl; the most likely thing is that you
are mad. But here you sit guzzling boiled beef as though youd not had
a bite for three days. Though as far as that goes madmen eat too but
though you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad! That Id
swear! Above all you are not mad! So you may go to hell all of you
for theres some mystery some secret about it and I dont intend to
worry my brains over your secrets. So Ive simply come to swear at you
 he finished getting up to relieve my mind. And I know what to do
now.

What do you mean to do now?

What business is it of yours what I mean to do?

You are going in for a drinking bout.

How... how did you know?

Why its pretty plain.

Razumihin paused for a minute.

You always have been a very rational person and youve never been mad
never he observed suddenly with warmth. Youre right: I shall drink.
Good-bye!

And he moved to go out.

I was talking with my sister--the day before yesterday I think it
was--about you Razumihin.

About me! But... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?
 Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale.

One could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently.

She came here by herself sat there and talked to me.

She did!

Yes.

What did you say to her... I mean about me?

I told her you were a very good honest and industrious man. I didnt
tell her you love her because she knows that herself.

She knows that herself?

Well its pretty plain. Wherever I might go whatever happened to me
you would remain to look after them. I so to speak give them into your
keeping Razumihin. I say this because I know quite well how you love
her and am convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too
may love you and perhaps does love you already. Now decide for yourself
as you know best whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not.

Rodya! You see... well.... Ach damn it! But where do you mean to go?
Of course if its all a secret never mind.... But I... I shall find
out the secret... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense
and that youve made it all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow a
capital fellow!...

That was just what I wanted to add only you interrupted that that was
a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets. Leave it to
time dont worry about it. Youll know it all in time when it must be.
Yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air fresh
air fresh air. I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant
by that.

Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement making a silent
conclusion.

Hes a political conspirator! He must be. And hes on the eve of some
desperate step thats certain. It can only be that! And... and Dounia
knows he thought suddenly.

So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you he said weighing each
syllable and youre going to see a man who says we need more air and
so of course that letter... that too must have something to do with it
 he concluded to himself.

What letter?

She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much--very much indeed. Too
much so. I began speaking of you she begged me not to. Then... then
she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she began
warmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked
herself in.

She got a letter? Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.

Yes and you didnt know? hm...

They were both silent.

Good-bye Rodion. There was a time brother when I.... Never mind
good-bye. You see there was a time.... Well good-bye! I must be off
too. I am not going to drink. Theres no need now.... Thats all stuff!

He hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him he
suddenly opened it again and said looking away:

Oh by the way do you remember that murder you know Porfirys that
old woman? Do you know the murderer has been found he has confessed
and given the proofs. Its one of those very workmen the painter only
fancy! Do you remember I defended them here? Would you believe it all
that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs
while the porter and the two witnesses were going up he got up on
purpose to disarm suspicion. The cunning the presence of mind of the
young dog! One can hardly credit it; but its his own explanation he
has confessed it all. And what a fool I was about it! Well hes simply
a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of
the lawyers--so theres nothing much to wonder at I suppose! Of course
people like that are always possible. And the fact that he couldnt keep
up the character but confessed makes him easier to believe in. But
what a fool I was! I was frantic on their side!

Tell me please from whom did you hear that and why does it interest
you so? Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation.

What next? You ask me why it interests me!... Well I heard it from
Porfiry among others... It was from him I heard almost all about it.

From Porfiry?

From Porfiry.

What... what did he say? Raskolnikov asked in dismay.

He gave me a capital explanation of it. Psychologically after his
fashion.

He explained it? Explained it himself?

Yes yes; good-bye. Ill tell you all about it another time but now
Im busy. There was a time when I fancied... But no matter another
time!... What need is there for me to drink now? You have made me drunk
without wine. I am drunk Rodya! Good-bye Im going. Ill come again
very soon.

He went out.

Hes a political conspirator theres not a doubt about it Razumihin
decided as he slowly descended the stairs. And hes drawn his sister
in; thats quite quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovnas character.
There are interviews between them!... She hinted at it too... So many of
her words.... and hints... bear that meaning! And how else can all this
tangle be explained? Hm! And I was almost thinking... Good heavens
what I thought! Yes I took leave of my senses and I wronged him! It was
his doing under the lamp in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude
nasty vile idea on my part! Nikolay is a brick for confessing.... And
how clear it all is now! His illness then all his strange actions...
before this in the university how morose he used to be how gloomy....
But whats the meaning now of that letter? Theres something in that
too perhaps. Whom was it from? I suspect...! No I must find out!

He thought of Dounia realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed
and he suddenly broke into a run.

As soon as Razumihin went out Raskolnikov got up turned to the window
walked into one corner and then into another as though forgetting the
smallness of his room and sat down again on the sofa. He felt so to
speak renewed; again the struggle so a means of escape had come.

Yes a means of escape had come! It had been too stifling too
cramping the burden had been too agonising. A lethargy had come upon
him at times. From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfirys he
had been suffocating penned in without hope of escape. After Nikolays
confession on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his
behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he
could have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler instantly and
fundamentally! And he had agreed at the time with Sonia he had agreed
in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his
mind!

And Svidrigalov was a riddle... He worried him that was true but
somehow not on the same point. He might still have a struggle to come
with Svidrigalov. Svidrigalov too might be a means of escape; but
Porfiry was a different matter.

And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin had explained it
_psychologically_. He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!
Porfiry? But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that
Nikolay was guilty after what had passed between them before Nikolays
appearance after that tte--tte interview which could have only
_one_ explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled
passages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind
rest on it.) Such words such gestures had passed between them they
had exchanged such glances things had been said in such a tone and had
reached such a pass that Nikolay whom Porfiry had seen through at the
first word at the first gesture could not have shaken his conviction.

And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! The scene in the
corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then. He had rushed to
Porfiry.... But what had induced the latter to receive him like that?
What had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He must
have some plan; there was some design but what was it? It was true that
a long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sight
nor sound of Porfiry. Well that was a bad sign....

Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room still pondering. It
was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind
at least. I must settle Svidrigalov he thought and as soon as
possible; he too seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own
accord. And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his
weary heart that he might have killed either of those two--Porfiry or
Svidrigalov. At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it
later if not now.

We shall see we shall see he repeated to himself.

But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry
himself in the passage. He was coming in to see him. Raskolnikov was
dumbfounded for a minute but only for one minute. Strange to say he
was not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of
him. He was simply startled but was quickly instantly on his guard.
Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have approached
so quietly like a cat so that he had heard nothing? Could he have been
listening at the door?

You didnt expect a visitor Rodion Romanovitch Porfiry explained
laughing. Ive been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by
and thought why not go in for five minutes. Are you going out? I wont
keep you long. Just let me have one cigarette.

Sit down Porfiry Petrovitch sit down. Raskolnikov gave his visitor
a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have
marvelled at himself if he could have seen it.

The last moment had come the last drops had to be drained! So a man
will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand
yet when the knife is at his throat at last he feels no fear.

Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry and looked at him
without flinching. Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a
cigarette.

Speak speak seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikovs
heart. Come why dont you speak?



CHAPTER II

Ah these cigarettes! Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last having
lighted one. They are pernicious positively pernicious and yet I
cant give them up! I cough I begin to have tickling in my throat and
a difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward I went lately to
Dr. B----n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. He
positively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: Tobaccos bad for
you he said your lungs are affected. But how am I to give it up?
What is there to take its place? I dont drink thats the mischief
he-he-he that I dont. Everything is relative Rodion Romanovitch
everything is relative!

Why hes playing his professional tricks again Raskolnikov thought
with disgust. All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly
came back to him and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon
him then.

I came to see you the day before yesterday in the evening; you didnt
know? Porfiry Petrovitch went on looking round the room. I came into
this very room. I was passing by just as I did to-day and I thought
Id return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open I looked
round waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.
Dont you lock your door?

Raskolnikovs face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry seemed to guess
his state of mind.

Ive come to have it out with you Rodion Romanovitch my dear fellow!
I owe you an explanation and must give it to you he continued with a
slight smile just patting Raskolnikovs knee.

But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his
face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He had
never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face.

A strange scene passed between us last time we met Rodion Romanovitch.
Our first interview too was a strange one; but then... and one thing
after another! This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you;
I feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and
your knees were shaking and so were mine. And you know our behaviour
was unseemly even ungentlemanly. And yet we are gentlemen above all
in any case gentlemen; that must be understood. Do you remember what we
came to?... and it was quite indecorous.

What is he up to what does he take me for? Raskolnikov asked himself
in amazement raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry.

Ive decided openness is better between us Porfiry Petrovitch went
on turning his head away and dropping his eyes as though unwilling to
disconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles.
Yes such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Nikolay
put a stop to it or I dont know what we might not have come to. That
damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realise
that? You know that of course; and I am aware that he came to you
afterwards. But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for
anyone I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadnt? What
shall I say to you? it had all come upon me so suddenly. I had scarcely
sent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out I dare say).
An idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time you see
Rodion Romanovitch. Come I thought--even if I let one thing slip for
a time I shall get hold of something else--I shant lose what I want
anyway. You are nervously irritable Rodion Romanovitch by temperament;
its out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character
which I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I did
reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and
blurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes if you make a
man lose all patience though even then its rare. I was capable of
realising that. If I only had a fact I thought the least little fact
to go upon something I could lay hold of something tangible not
merely psychological. For if a man is guilty you must be able to get
something substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising
results indeed. I was reckoning on your temperament Rodion Romanovitch
on your temperament above all things! I had great hopes of you at that
time.

But what are you driving at now? Raskolnikov muttered at last asking
the question without thinking.

What is he talking about? he wondered distractedly does he really
take me to be innocent?

What am I driving at? Ive come to explain myself I consider it my
duty so to speak. I want to make clear to you how the whole business
the whole misunderstanding arose. Ive caused you a great deal of
suffering Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster. I understand what
it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate but who is proud
imperious and above all impatient to have to bear such treatment!
I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without
elements of magnanimity though I dont agree with all your convictions.
I wanted to tell you this first frankly and quite sincerely for above
all I dont want to deceive you. When I made your acquaintance I felt
attracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a
right to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed youve no
reason to like me. You may think what you like but I desire now to do
all I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart
and conscience. I speak sincerely.

Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov felt a rush of
renewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent
began to make him uneasy.

Its scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail Porfiry
Petrovitch went on. Indeed I could scarcely attempt it. To begin with
there were rumours. Through whom how and when those rumours came to
me... and how they affected you I need not go into. My suspicions
were aroused by a complete accident which might just as easily not have
happened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into that
either. Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind. I
admit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I was
the first to pitch on you. The old womans notes on the pledges and
the rest of it--that all came to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred.
I happened too to hear of the scene at the office from a man who
described it capitally unconsciously reproducing the scene with great
vividness. It was just one thing after another Rodion Romanovitch my
dear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas? From a
hundred rabbits you cant make a horse a hundred suspicions dont make
a proof as the English proverb says but thats only from the rational
point of view--you cant help being partial for after all a lawyer
is only human. I thought too of your article in that journal do you
remember on your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you at the
time but that was only to lead you on. I repeat Rodion Romanovitch
you are ill and impatient. That you were bold headstrong in earnest
and... had felt a great deal I recognised long before. I too have felt
the same so that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceived
on sleepless nights with a throbbing heart in ecstasy and suppressed
enthusiasm. And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is
dangerous! I jeered at you then but let me tell you that as a literary
amateur I am awfully fond of such first essays full of the heat of
youth. There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your
article is absurd and fantastic but theres a transparent sincerity
a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it. Its a
gloomy article but thats whats fine in it. I read your article and
put it aside thinking as I did so that man wont go the common way.
Well I ask you after that as a preliminary how could I help being
carried away by what followed? Oh dear I am not saying anything I
am not making any statement now. I simply noted it at the time. What is
there in it? I reflected. Theres nothing in it that is really nothing
and perhaps absolutely nothing. And its not at all the thing for
the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here I have
Nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him--you may think what
you like of it but its evidence. He brings in his psychology too; one
has to consider him too for its a matter of life and death. Why am
I explaining this to you? That you may understand and not blame my
malicious behaviour on that occasion. It was not malicious I assure
you he-he! Do you suppose I didnt come to search your room at the
time? I did I did he-he! I was here when you were lying ill in bed
not officially not in my own person but I was here. Your room was
searched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but _umsonst_! I
thought to myself now that man will come will come of himself and
quickly too; if hes guilty hes sure to come. Another man wouldnt
but he will. And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the
subject with you? We arranged that to excite you so we purposely spread
rumours that he might discuss the case with you and Razumihin is not a
man to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck by
your anger and your open daring. Think of blurting out in a restaurant
I killed her. It was too daring too reckless. I thought so myself if
he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent. That was what I thought
at the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Zametov over
and... well you see it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology
can be taken two ways! Well I kept expecting you and so it was you
came! My heart was fairly throbbing. Ach!

Now why need you have come? Your laughter too as you came in do you
remember? I saw it all plain as daylight but if I hadnt expected you
so specially I should not have noticed anything in your laughter. You
see what influence a mood has! Mr. Razumihin then--ah that stone that
stone under which the things were hidden! I seem to see it somewhere
in a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden you told Zametov and
afterwards you repeated that in my office? And when we began picking
your article to pieces how you explained it! One could take every word
of yours in two senses as though there were another meaning hidden.

So in this way Rodion Romanovitch I reached the furthest limit and
knocking my head against a post I pulled myself up asking myself what
I was about. After all I said you can take it all in another sense if
you like and its more natural so indeed. I couldnt help admitting
it was more natural. I was bothered! No Id better get hold of some
little fact I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing I held my
breath and was all in a tremor. Here is my little fact thought I and
I didnt think it over I simply wouldnt. I would have given a thousand
roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes when you
walked a hundred paces beside that workman after he had called you
murderer to your face and you did not dare to ask him a question
all the way. And then what about your trembling what about your
bell-ringing in your illness in semi-delirium?

And so Rodion Romanovitch can you wonder that I played such pranks on
you? And what made you come at that very minute? Someone seemed to
have sent you by Jove! And if Nikolay had not parted us... and do you
remember Nikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was a
thunderbolt a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! I didnt believe
in the thunderbolt not for a minute. You could see it for yourself;
and how could I? Even afterwards when you had gone and he began making
very very plausible answers on certain points so that I was surprised
at him myself even then I didnt believe his story! You see what it is
to be as firm as a rock! No thought I _Morgenfrh_. What has Nikolay
got to do with it!

Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had
yourself assured him of it....

His voice failed him and he broke off. He had been listening in
indescribable agitation as this man who had seen through and through
him went back upon himself. He was afraid of believing it and did not
believe it. In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for
something more definite and conclusive.

Mr. Razumihin! cried Porfiry Petrovitch seeming glad of a question
from Raskolnikov who had till then been silent. He-he-he! But I had to
put Mr. Razumihin off; two is company three is none. Mr. Razumihin is
not the right man besides he is an outsider. He came running to me
with a pale face.... But never mind him why bring him in? To return
to Nikolay would you like to know what sort of a type he is how I
understand him that is? To begin with he is still a child and not
exactly a coward but something by way of an artist. Really dont laugh
at my describing him so. He is innocent and responsive to influence. He
has a heart and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances he tells
stories they say so that people come from other villages to hear him.
He attends school too and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger
to him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice but at
times when people treat him like a child. And he stole too then
without knowing it himself for How can it be stealing if one picks it
up? And do you know he is an Old Believer or rather a dissenter? There
have been Wanderers[*] in his family and he was for two years in his
village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder. I learnt all
this from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers. And whats more he
wanted to run into the wilderness! He was full of fervour prayed at
night read the old books the true ones and read himself crazy.

     [*] A religious sect.--TRANSLATORS NOTE.

Petersburg had a great effect upon him especially the women and the
wine. He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that. I
learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him and used to go and see
him and now this business came upon him.

Well he was frightened he tried to hang himself! He ran away! How can
one get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings? The
very word trial frightens some of them. Whose fault is it? We shall
see what the new juries will do. God grant they do good! Well in
prison it seems he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible too
made its appearance again. Do you know Rodion Romanovitch the force of
the word suffering among some of these people! Its not a question of
suffering for someones benefit but simply one must suffer. If they
suffer at the hands of the authorities so much the better. In my time
there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison
always reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself
crazy and so crazy do you know that one day apropos of nothing he
seized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him
no harm. And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side
on purpose for fear of hurting him. Well we know what happens to
a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon. So he took his
suffering.

So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or something
of the sort. I know it for certain from facts indeed. Only he doesnt
know that I know. What you dont admit that there are such fantastic
people among the peasants? Lots of them. The elder now has begun
influencing him especially since he tried to hang himself. But hell
come and tell me all himself. You think hell hold out? Wait a bit
hell take his words back. I am waiting from hour to hour for him to
come and abjure his evidence. I have come to like that Nikolay and am
studying him in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He answered me
very plausibly on some points he obviously had collected some evidence
and prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is simply at sea
knows nothing and doesnt even suspect that he doesnt know!

No Rodion Romanovitch Nikolay doesnt come in! This is a fantastic
gloomy business a modern case an incident of to-day when the heart
of man is troubled when the phrase is quoted that blood renews when
comfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams a
heart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage
but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over
a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the
crime. He forgot to shut the door after him and murdered two people for
a theory. He committed the murder and couldnt take the money and what
he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. It wasnt enough for
him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and
rung the bell no he had to go to the empty lodging half delirious to
recall the bell-ringing he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....
Well that we grant was through illness but consider this: he is
a murderer but looks upon himself as an honest man despises others
poses as injured innocence. No thats not the work of a Nikolay my
dear Rodion Romanovitch!

All that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that
these words were too great a shock. Raskolnikov shuddered as though he
had been stabbed.

Then... who then... is the murderer? he asked in a breathless voice
unable to restrain himself.

Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair as though he were amazed at
the question.

Who is the murderer? he repeated as though unable to believe his
ears. Why _you_ Rodion Romanovitch! You are the murderer he added
almost in a whisper in a voice of genuine conviction.

Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa stood up for a few seconds and sat down
again without uttering a word. His face twitched convulsively.

Your lip is twitching just as it did before Porfiry Petrovitch
observed almost sympathetically. Youve been misunderstanding me I
think Rodion Romanovitch he added after a brief pause thats why
you are so surprised. I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal
openly with you.

It was not I murdered her Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened
child caught in the act.

No it was you you Rodion Romanovitch and no one else Porfiry
whispered sternly with conviction.

They were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long about ten
minutes. Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers
through his hair. Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting. Suddenly
Raskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry.

You are at your old tricks again Porfiry Petrovitch! Your old method
again. I wonder you dont get sick of it!

Oh stop that what does that matter now? It would be a different
matter if there were witnesses present but we are whispering alone. You
see yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare.
Whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself I am
convinced without it.

If so what did you come for? Raskolnikov asked irritably. I ask you
the same question again: if you consider me guilty why dont you take
me to prison?

Oh thats your question! I will answer you point for point. In the
first place to arrest you so directly is not to my interest.

How so? If you are convinced you ought....

Ach what if I am convinced? Thats only my dream for the time. Why
should I put you in safety? You know thats it since you ask me to do
it. If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him
were you drunk or not? Who saw me with you? I simply took you to be
drunk and you were drunk too. Well what could I answer especially
as your story is a more likely one than his? for theres nothing but
psychology to support his evidence--thats almost unseemly with his ugly
mug while you hit the mark exactly for the rascal is an inveterate
drunkard and notoriously so. And I have myself admitted candidly several
times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the
second way is stronger and looks far more probable and that apart from
that I have as yet nothing against you. And though I shall put you in
prison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform you
of it beforehand yet I tell you frankly also contrary to etiquette
that it wont be to my advantage. Well secondly Ive come to you
because...

Yes yes secondly? Raskolnikov was listening breathless.

Because as I told you just now I consider I owe you an explanation. I
dont want you to look upon me as a monster as I have a genuine liking
for you you may believe me or not. And in the third place Ive come to
you with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrender
and confess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my
advantage too for my task will be done. Well is this open on my part
or not?

Raskolnikov thought a minute.

Listen Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you have nothing but
psychology to go on yet now youve gone on mathematics. Well what if
you are mistaken yourself now?

No Rodion Romanovitch I am not mistaken. I have a little fact even
then Providence sent it me.

What little fact?

I wont tell you what Rodion Romanovitch. And in any case I havent
the right to put it off any longer I must arrest you. So think it over:
it makes no difference to me _now_ and so I speak only for your sake.
Believe me it will be better Rodion Romanovitch.

Raskolnikov smiled malignantly.

Thats not simply ridiculous its positively shameless. Why even if I
were guilty which I dont admit what reason should I have to confess
when you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison?

Ah Rodion Romanovitch dont put too much faith in words perhaps
prison will not be altogether a restful place. Thats only theory and
my theory and what authority am I for you? Perhaps too even now I am
hiding something from you? I cant lay bare everything he-he! And how
can you ask what advantage? Dont you know how it would lessen your
sentence? You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken
the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case. Consider that! I
swear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall
come as a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all these
psychological points of a suspicion against you so that your crime
will appear to have been something like an aberration for in truth it
was an aberration. I am an honest man Rodion Romanovitch and will keep
my word.

Raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink
dejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last smiled again but his
smile was sad and gentle.

No! he said apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances
with Porfiry its not worth it I dont care about lessening the
sentence!

Thats just what I was afraid of! Porfiry cried warmly and as it
seemed involuntarily. Thats just what I feared that you wouldnt
care about the mitigation of sentence.

Raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.

Ah dont disdain life! Porfiry went on. You have a great deal of
it still before you. How can you say you dont want a mitigation of
sentence? You are an impatient fellow!

A great deal of what lies before me?

Of life. What sort of prophet are you do you know much about it? Seek
and ye shall find. This may be Gods means for bringing you to Him. And
its not for ever the bondage....

The time will be shortened laughed Raskolnikov.

Why is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It may be that you
are afraid of it without knowing it because you are young! But anyway
_you_ shouldnt be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing.

Ach hang it! Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt as
though he did not want to speak aloud.

He got up again as though he meant to go away but sat down again in
evident despair.

Hang it if you like! Youve lost faith and you think that I am
grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? How much do
you understand? You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke
down and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out something
base thats true but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base!
At least you didnt deceive yourself for long you went straight to the
furthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I regard you as one
of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts
their entrails out if only they have found faith or God. Find it and
you will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering too
is a good thing. Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer.
I know you dont believe in it--but dont be over-wise; fling yourself
straight into life without deliberation; dont be afraid--the flood
will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again. What
bank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have long life before
you. I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared
beforehand but maybe you will remember them after. They may be of use
some time. Thats why I speak. Its as well that you only killed the
old woman. If youd invented another theory you might perhaps have
done something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God
perhaps. How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something.
But keep a good heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the great
expiation before you? No it would be shameful to be afraid of it. Since
you have taken such a step you must harden your heart. There is justice
in it. You must fulfil the demands of justice. I know that you dont
believe it but indeed life will bring you through. You will live it
down in time. What you need now is fresh air fresh air fresh air!

Raskolnikov positively started.

But who are you? what prophet are you? From the height of what majestic
calm do you proclaim these words of wisdom?

Who am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for thats all. A man
perhaps of feeling and sympathy maybe of some knowledge too but my day
is over. But you are a different matter there is life waiting for you.
Though who knows? maybe your life too will pass off in smoke and come
to nothing. Come what does it matter that you will pass into another
class of men? Its not comfort you regret with your heart! What of
it that perhaps no one will see you for so long? Its not time but
yourself that will decide that. Be the sun and all will see you. The
sun has before all to be the sun. Why are you smiling again? At my being
such a Schiller? I bet youre imagining that I am trying to get round
you by flattery. Well perhaps I am he-he-he! Perhaps youd better not
believe my word perhaps youd better never believe it altogether--Im
made that way I confess it. But let me add you can judge for yourself
I think how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest.

When do you mean to arrest me?

Well I can let you walk about another day or two. Think it over my
dear fellow and pray to God. Its more in your interest believe me.

And what if I run away? asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile.

No you wont run away. A peasant would run away a fashionable
dissenter would run away the flunkey of another mans thought for
youve only to show him the end of your little finger and hell be ready
to believe in anything for the rest of his life. But youve ceased to
believe in your theory already what will you run away with? And what
would you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you and
what you need more than anything in life is a definite position an
atmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If
you ran away youd come back to yourself. _You cant get on without
us._ And if I put you in prison--say youve been there a month or two
or three--remember my word youll confess of yourself and perhaps to
your own surprise. You wont know an hour beforehand that you are coming
with a confession. I am convinced that you will decide to take your
suffering. You dont believe my words now but youll come to it of
yourself. For suffering Rodion Romanovitch is a great thing. Never
mind my having grown fat I know all the same. Dont laugh at it
theres an idea in suffering Nikolay is right. No you wont run away
Rodion Romanovitch.

Raskolnikov got up and took his cap. Porfiry Petrovitch also rose.

Are you going for a walk? The evening will be fine if only we dont
have a storm. Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air.

He too took his cap.

Porfiry Petrovitch please dont take up the notion that I have
confessed to you to-day Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.
Youre a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity.
But I have admitted nothing remember that!

Oh I know that Ill remember. Look at him hes trembling! Dont
be uneasy my dear fellow have it your own way. Walk about a bit you
wont be able to walk too far. If anything happens I have one request
to make of you he added dropping his voice. Its an awkward one but
important. If anything were to happen (though indeed I dont believe
in it and think you quite incapable of it) yet in case you were taken
during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to
the business in some other way in some fantastic fashion--laying hands
on yourself--(its an absurd proposition but you must forgive me for
it) do leave a brief but precise note only two lines and mention the
stone. It will be more generous. Come till we meet! Good thoughts and
sound decisions to you!

Porfiry went out stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. The
latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he
calculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away. Then he
too went hurriedly out of the room.



CHAPTER III

He hurried to Svidrigalovs. What he had to hope from that man he
did not know. But that man had some hidden power over him. Having once
recognised this he could not rest and now the time had come.

On the way one question particularly worried him: had Svidrigalov been
to Porfirys?

As far as he could judge he would swear to it that he had not. He
pondered again and again went over Porfirys visit; no he hadnt been
of course he hadnt.

But if he had not been yet would he go? Meanwhile for the present he
fancied he couldnt. Why? He could not have explained but if he could
he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment. It all
worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it. Strange to
say none would have believed it perhaps but he only felt a faint vague
anxiety about his immediate future. Another much more important anxiety
tormented him--it concerned himself but in a different more vital way.
Moreover he was conscious of immense moral fatigue though his mind was
working better that morning than it had done of late.

And was it worth while after all that had happened to contend with
these new trivial difficulties? Was it worth while for instance to
manoeuvre that Svidrigalov should not go to Porfirys? Was it worth
while to investigate to ascertain the facts to waste time over anyone
like Svidrigalov?

Oh how sick he was of it all!

And yet he was hastening to Svidrigalov; could he be expecting
something _new_ from him information or means of escape? Men will
catch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?
Perhaps it was only fatigue despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigalov
but some other whom he needed and Svidrigalov had simply presented
himself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia for now? To beg
her tears again? He was afraid of Sonia too. Sonia stood before him as
an irrevocable sentence. He must go his own way or hers. At that moment
especially he did not feel equal to seeing her. No would it not be
better to try Svidrigalov? And he could not help inwardly owning that
he had long felt that he must see him for some reason.

But what could they have in common? Their very evil-doing could not
be of the same kind. The man moreover was very unpleasant evidently
depraved undoubtedly cunning and deceitful possibly malignant. Such
stories were told about him. It is true he was befriending Katerina
Ivanovnas children but who could tell with what motive and what it
meant? The man always had some design some project.

There was another thought which had been continually hovering of late
about Raskolnikovs mind and causing him great uneasiness. It was so
painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it. He sometimes
thought that Svidrigalov was dogging his footsteps. Svidrigalov had
found out his secret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he had them
still? Wasnt it practically certain that he had? And what if having
learnt his secret and so having gained power over him he were to use it
as a weapon against Dounia?

This idea sometimes even tormented his dreams but it had never
presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to Svidrigalov.
The very thought moved him to gloomy rage. To begin with this would
transform everything even his own position; he would have at once to
confess his secret to Dounia. Would he have to give himself up perhaps
to prevent Dounia from taking some rash step? The letter? This morning
Dounia had received a letter. From whom could she get letters in
Petersburg? Luzhin perhaps? Its true Razumihin was there to protect
her but Razumihin knew nothing of the position. Perhaps it was his duty
to tell Razumihin? He thought of it with repugnance.

In any case he must see Svidrigalov as soon as possible he decided
finally. Thank God the details of the interview were of little
consequence if only he could get at the root of the matter; but
if Svidrigalov were capable... if he were intriguing against
Dounia--then...

Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month
that he could only decide such questions in one way; then I shall kill
him he thought in cold despair.

A sudden anguish oppressed his heart he stood still in the middle of
the street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he
was going. He found himself in X. Prospect thirty or forty paces from
the Hay Market through which he had come. The whole second storey of
the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide
open; judging from the figures moving at the windows the rooms were
full to overflowing. There were sounds of singing of clarionet and
violin and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.
He was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. Prospect
when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigalov sitting
at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.
Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback almost terrified. Svidrigalov
was silently watching and scrutinising him and what struck Raskolnikov
at once seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.
Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him but to be looking
absent-mindedly away while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.
His heart was beating violently. Yet it was evident that Svidrigalov
did not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on
the point of concealing himself but as he got up and moved back his
chair he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen
him and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the
same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikovs room. A
sly smile came into Svidrigalovs face and grew broader and
broader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At last
Svidrigalov broke into a loud laugh.

Well well come in if you want me; I am here! he shouted from the
window.

Raskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svidrigalov in a tiny
back room adjoining the saloon in which merchants clerks and numbers
of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the
desperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls
could be heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigalov stood
an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found
also a boy with a little hand organ a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl
of eighteen wearing a tucked-up striped skirt and a Tyrolese hat with
ribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room she was singing some
servants hall song in a rather husky contralto to the accompaniment of
the organ.

Come thats enough Svidrigalov stopped her at Raskolnikovs
entrance. The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.
She had sung her guttural rhymes too with a serious and respectful
expression in her face.

Hey Philip a glass! shouted Svidrigalov.

I wont drink anything said Raskolnikov.

As you like I didnt mean it for you. Drink Katia! I dont want
anything more to-day you can go. He poured her out a full glass and
laid down a yellow note.

Katia drank off her glass of wine as women do without putting it down
in twenty gulps took the note and kissed Svidrigalovs hand which he
allowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed
after her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.
Svidrigalov had not been a week in Petersburg but everything about him
was already so to speak on a patriarchal footing; the waiter Philip
was by now an old friend and very obsequious.

The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidrigalov was at
home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was
dirty and wretched not even second-rate.

I was going to see you and looking for you Raskolnikov began but
I dont know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X. Prospect
just now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay
Market. And this isnt the way to you. I simply turned and here you are.
It is strange!

Why dont you say at once its a miracle?

Because it may be only chance.

Oh thats the way with all you folk laughed Svidrigalov. You wont
admit it even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle! Here you say
that it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here about
having an opinion of their own you cant fancy Rodion Romanovitch. I
dont mean you you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to
have it. Thats how it was you attracted my curiosity.

Nothing else?

Well thats enough you know Svidrigalov was obviously exhilarated
but only slightly so he had not had more than half a glass of wine.

I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having
what you call an opinion of my own observed Raskolnikov.

Oh well it was a different matter. Everyone has his own plans. And
apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep
for the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself there
is no miracle in your coming straight here. I explained the way myself
told you where it was and the hours you could find me here. Do you
remember?

I dont remember answered Raskolnikov with surprise.

I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been stamped
mechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yet
precisely according to the direction though you are not aware of
it. When I told you then I hardly hoped you understood me. You give
yourself away too much Rodion Romanovitch. And another thing Im
convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves
as they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If only we had scientific
men doctors lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable
investigations in Petersburg each in his own line. There are few places
where there are so many gloomy strong and queer influences on the soul
of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much.
And its the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must
be reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there
now. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out
of your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it
sink and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see
nothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and
talking to yourself and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim and at
last stand still in the middle of the road. Thats not at all the thing.
Someone may be watching you besides me and it wont do you any good.
Its nothing really to do with me and I cant cure you but of course
you understand me.

Do you know that I am being followed? asked Raskolnikov looking
inquisitively at him.

No I know nothing about it said Svidrigalov seeming surprised.

Well then let us leave me alone Raskolnikov muttered frowning.

Very good let us leave you alone.

You had better tell me if you come here to drink and directed me
twice to come here to you why did you hide and try to get away just
now when I looked at the window from the street? I saw it.

He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and
pretended to be asleep though you were wide awake while I stood in your
doorway? I saw it.

I may have had... reasons. You know that yourself.

And I may have had my reasons though you dont know them.

Raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table leaned his chin in the
fingers of his right hand and stared intently at Svidrigalov. For a
full minute he scrutinised his face which had impressed him before. It
was a strange face like a mask; white and red with bright red lips
with a flaxen beard and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow
too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There was
something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face which looked so
wonderfully young for his age. Svidrigalov was smartly dressed in light
summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge
ring with a precious stone in it.

Have I got to bother myself about you too now? said Raskolnikov
suddenly coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. Even
though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me
I dont want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that I
dont prize myself as you probably think I do. Ive come to tell you at
once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister
and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has
been discovered of late I will kill you before you get me locked up.
You can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. And in the
second place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying all
this time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it
for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late.

Why in such haste? asked Svidrigalov looking at him curiously.

Everyone has his plans Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently.

You urged me yourself to frankness just now and at the first question
you refuse to answer Svidrigalov observed with a smile. You
keep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with
suspicion. Of course its perfectly natural in your position. But
though I should like to be friends with you I shant trouble myself
to convince you of the contrary. The game isnt worth the candle and I
wasnt intending to talk to you about anything special.

What did you want me for then? It was you who came hanging about me.

Why simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked the
fantastic nature of your position--thats what it was! Besides you are
the brother of a person who greatly interested me and from that person
I had in the past heard a very great deal about you from which I
gathered that you had a great influence over her; isnt that enough?
Ha-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex and
is difficult for me to answer. Here you for instance have come to me
not only for a definite object but for the sake of hearing something
new. Isnt that so? Isnt that so? persisted Svidrigalov with a sly
smile. Well cant you fancy then that I too on my way here in the
train was reckoning on you on your telling me something new and on my
making some profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!

What profit could you make?

How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what a tavern I spend all
my time and its my enjoyment thats to say its no great enjoyment
but one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her?... If only
I had been a glutton now a club gourmand but you see I can eat this.

He pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a
terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.

Have you dined by the way? Ive had something and want nothing more.
I dont drink for instance at all. Except for champagne I never touch
anything and not more than a glass of that all the evening and even
that is enough to make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind
myself up for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a
peculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just now like a
schoolboy for I was afraid you would hinder me. But I believe he
pulled out his watch I can spend an hour with you. Its half-past
four now. If only Id been something a landowner a father a cavalry
officer a photographer a journalist... I am nothing no specialty
and sometimes I am positively bored. I really thought you would tell me
something new.

But what are you and why have you come here?

What am I? You know a gentleman I served for two years in the
cavalry then I knocked about here in Petersburg then I married Marfa
Petrovna and lived in the country. There you have my biography!

You are a gambler I believe?

No a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper--not a gambler.

You have been a card-sharper then?

Yes Ive been a card-sharper too.

Didnt you get thrashed sometimes?

It did happen. Why?

Why you might have challenged them... altogether it must have been
lively.

I wont contradict you and besides I am no hand at philosophy. I
confess that I hastened here for the sake of the women.

As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?

Quite so Svidrigalov smiled with engaging candour. What of it? You
seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?

You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?

Vice! Oh thats what you are after! But Ill answer you in order
first about women in general; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me
what should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women since I
have a passion for them? Its an occupation anyway.

So you hope for nothing here but vice?

Oh very well for vice then. You insist on its being vice. But anyway
I like a direct question. In this vice at least there is something
permanent founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy
something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember for ever
setting one on fire and maybe not to be quickly extinguished even
with years. Youll agree its an occupation of a sort.

Thats nothing to rejoice at its a disease and a dangerous one.

Oh thats what you think is it! I agree that it is a disease like
everything that exceeds moderation. And of course in this one must
exceed moderation. But in the first place everybody does so in one way
or another and in the second place of course one ought to be moderate
and prudent however mean it may be but what am I to do? If I hadnt
this I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that a decent
man ought to put up with being bored but yet...

And could you shoot yourself?

Oh come! Svidrigalov parried with disgust. Please dont speak of
it he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown
in all the previous conversation. His face quite changed. I admit its
an unpardonable weakness but I cant help it. I am afraid of death and
I dislike its being talked of. Do you know that I am to a certain extent
a mystic?

Ah the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they still go on visiting
you?

Oh dont talk of them; there have been no more in Petersburg confound
them! he cried with an air of irritation. Lets rather talk of that...
though... Hm! I have not much time and cant stay long with you
its a pity! I should have found plenty to tell you.

Whats your engagement a woman?

Yes a woman a casual incident.... No thats not what I want to talk
of.

And the hideousness the filthiness of all your surroundings doesnt
that affect you? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?

And do you pretend to strength too? He-he-he! You surprised me just
now Rodion Romanovitch though I knew beforehand it would be so.
You preach to me about vice and sthetics! You--a Schiller you--an
idealist! Of course thats all as it should be and it would be
surprising if it were not so yet it is strange in reality.... Ah
what a pity I have no time for youre a most interesting type! And
by-the-way are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him.

But what a braggart you are Raskolnikov said with some disgust.

Upon my word I am not answered Svidrigalov laughing. However I
wont dispute it let me be a braggart why not brag if it hurts no
one? I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna so now when
I come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly
interesting--I am simply glad to talk and besides Ive drunk that
half-glass of champagne and its gone to my head a little. And besides
theres a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously but about that
I... will keep quiet. Where are you off to? he asked in alarm.

Raskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and
as it were ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that
Svidrigalov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.

A-ach! Sit down stay a little! Svidrigalov begged. Let them bring
you some tea anyway. Stay a little I wont talk nonsense about
myself I mean. Ill tell you something. If you like Ill tell you how a
woman tried to save me as you would call it? It will be an answer to
your first question indeed for the woman was your sister. May I tell
you? It will help to spend the time.

Tell me but I trust that you...

Oh dont be uneasy. Besides even in a worthless low fellow like me
Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect.



CHAPTER IV

You know perhaps--yes I told you myself began Svidrigalov that
I was in the debtors prison here for an immense sum and had not
any expectation of being able to pay it. Theres no need to go into
particulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a
point of insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest woman
and very sensible although completely uneducated. Would you believe
that this honest and jealous woman after many scenes of hysterics and
reproaches condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which
she kept throughout our married life? She was considerably older than
I and besides she always kept a clove or something in her mouth. There
was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too of a sort as to
tell her straight out that I couldnt be absolutely faithful to her.
This confession drove her to frenzy but yet she seems in a way to have
liked my brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling to
deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous
woman you know thats the first consideration. After many tears an
unwritten contract was drawn up between us: first that I would never
leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly that I
would never absent myself without her permission; thirdly that I would
never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly in return for this Marfa
Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants but only with her
secret knowledge; fifthly God forbid my falling in love with a woman of
our class; sixthly in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by
a great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. On
this last score however Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. She was a
sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute
profligate incapable of real love. But a sensible woman and a jealous
woman are two very different things and thats where the trouble
came in. But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain
preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people
about us. I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than
in anyones. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was
ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very
ridiculous ways but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the
innumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well and thats enough I
think by way of a decorous _oraison funbre_ for the most tender wife
of a most tender husband. When we quarrelled I usually held my tongue
and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to
attain its object it influenced her it pleased her indeed. These were
times when she was positively proud of me. But your sister she couldnt
put up with anyway. And however she came to risk taking such a
beautiful creature into her house as a governess. My explanation is that
Marfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell
in love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister. Well little
wonder--look at Avdotya Romanovna! I saw the danger at the first glance
and what do you think I resolved not to look at her even. But Avdotya
Romanovna herself made the first step would you believe it? Would you
believe it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first
for my persistent silence about your sister for my careless reception
of her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I dont know
what it was she wanted! Well of course Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya
Romanovna every detail about me. She had the unfortunate habit of
telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually
complaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful
new friend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt
Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were
current about me.... I dont mind betting that you too have heard
something of the sort already?

I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child. Is
that true?

Dont refer to those vulgar tales I beg said Svidrigalov with
disgust and annoyance. If you insist on wanting to know about all that
idiocy I will tell you one day but now...

I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you
treated badly.

I beg you to drop the subject Svidrigalov interrupted again with
obvious impatience.

Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...
you told me about it yourself. Raskolnikov felt more and more
irritated.

Svidrigalov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught
a flash of spiteful mockery in that look. But Svidrigalov restrained
himself and answered very civilly:

Yes it was. I see that you too are extremely interested and shall
feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon
my soul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with
some people. Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having
repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip
about me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her but in any
case it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Romanovnas natural
aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--she
did at least feel pity for me pity for a lost soul. And if once a
girls heart is moved to _pity_ its more dangerous than anything. She
is bound to want to save him to bring him to his senses and lift
him up and draw him to nobler aims and restore him to new life and
usefulness--well we all know how far such dreams can go. I saw at once
that the bird was flying into the cage of herself. And I too made ready.
I think you are frowning Rodion Romanovitch? Theres no need. As you
know it all ended in smoke. (Hang it all what a lot I am drinking!)
Do you know I always from the very beginning regretted that it wasnt
your sisters fate to be born in the second or third century A.D. as
the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia
Minor. She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure
martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot
pincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And in the fourth or
fifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and
would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and
visions. She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone and
if she cant get her torture shell throw herself out of a window. Ive
heard something of a Mr. Razumihin--hes said to be a sensible fellow;
his surname suggests it indeed. Hes probably a divinity student. Well
hed better look after your sister! I believe I understand her and I am
proud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance as you know one
is apt to be more heedless and stupid. One doesnt see clearly. Hang it
all why is she so handsome? Its not my fault. In fact it began on
my side with a most irresistible physical desire. Avdotya Romanovna is
awfully chaste incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note I tell you
this about your sister as a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste in
spite of her broad intelligence and it will stand in her way. There
happened to be a girl in the house then Parasha a black-eyed
wench whom I had never seen before--she had just come from another
village--very pretty but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears
wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.
One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in
the garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha
alone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I of course
was only too pleased to obey her wishes tried to appear disconcerted
embarrassed in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews
mysterious conversations exhortations entreaties supplications even
tears--would you believe it even tears? Think what the passion for
propaganda will bring some girls to! I of course threw it all on
my destiny posed as hungering and thirsting for light and finally
resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the
female heart a weapon which never fails one. Its the well-known
resource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the
truth and nothing easier than flattery. If theres the hundredth part
of a false note in speaking the truth it leads to a discord and that
leads to trouble. But if all to the last note is false in flattery it
is just as agreeable and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be
a coarse satisfaction but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the
flattery at least half will be sure to seem true. Thats so for all
stages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be
seduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I once
seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband her children and her
principles. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really
had principles--of her own anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being
utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her
shamelessly and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of
the hand even a glance from her I would reproach myself for having
snatched it by force and would declare that she had resisted so that
I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.
I maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my
treachery and yielded to me unconsciously unawares and so on. In
fact I triumphed while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was
innocent chaste and faithful to all her duties and obligations and
had succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when I
explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was
just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of
flattery and if I had only cared to I might have had all her property
settled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine
now and talking too much.) I hope you wont be angry if I mention now
that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.
But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna had
several times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by
the expression of my eyes would you believe it? There was sometimes a
light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and
more unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail
but we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the
coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha
came on to the scene again and not she alone; in fact there was a
tremendous to-do. Ah Rodion Romanovitch if you could only see how your
sisters eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this
moment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.
I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of
her dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to think
that I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could
be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential indeed to be reconciled
but by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what
a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake
anything in a frenzy Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya
Romanovna was after all a beggar (ach excuse me thats not the word...
but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?) that she lived by
her work that she had her mother and you to keep (ach hang it you
are frowning again) and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty
thousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with
me here to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love
rapture and so on. Do you know I was so wild about her at that time
that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat
and to marry herself it would have been done at once! But it ended in
the catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I
was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly
attorney Luzhin and had almost made a match between them--which would
really have been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldnt it?
Wouldnt it? I notice that youve begun to be very attentive... you
interesting young man....

Svidrigalov struck the table with his fist impatiently. He was flushed.
Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne
that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he
resolved to take advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious
of Svidrigalov.

Well after what you have said I am fully convinced that you have
come to Petersburg with designs on my sister he said directly to
Svidrigalov in order to irritate him further.

Oh nonsense said Svidrigalov seeming to rouse himself. Why I
told you... besides your sister cant endure me.

Yes I am certain that she cant but thats not the point.

Are you so sure that she cant? Svidrigalov screwed up his eyes and
smiled mockingly. You are right she doesnt love me but you can
never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and
mistress. Theres always a little corner which remains a secret to
the world and is only known to those two. Will you answer for it that
Avdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?

From some words youve dropped I notice that you still have
designs--and of course evil ones--on Dounia and mean to carry them out
promptly.

What have I dropped words like that? Svidrigalov asked in nave
dismay taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his
designs.

Why you are dropping them even now. Why are you so frightened? What
are you so afraid of now?

Me--afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid of me _cher
ami_. But what nonsense.... Ive drunk too much though I see that. I
was almost saying too much again. Damn the wine! Hi! there water!

He snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of
the window. Philip brought the water.

Thats all nonsense! said Svidrigalov wetting a towel and putting it
to his head. But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your
suspicions. Do you know that I am going to get married?

You told me so before.

Did I? Ive forgotten. But I couldnt have told you so for certain for
I had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to. But now I really
have a betrothed and its a settled thing and if it werent that I have
business that cant be put off I would have taken you to see them
at once for I should like to ask your advice. Ach hang it only ten
minutes left! See look at the watch. But I must tell you for its an
interesting story my marriage in its own way. Where are you off to?
Going again?

No Im not going away now.

Not at all? We shall see. Ill take you there Ill show you my
betrothed only not now. For youll soon have to be off. You have to go
to the right and I to the left. Do you know that Madame Resslich the
woman I am lodging with now eh? I know what youre thinking that shes
the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come are
you listening? She arranged it all for me. Youre bored she said
you want something to fill up your time. For you know I am a gloomy
depressed person. Do you think Im light-hearted? No Im gloomy. I do
no harm but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a
time. And that Resslich is a sly hussy I tell you. I know what she has
got in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it abandon my wife and
depart and shell get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our
class of course or higher. She told me the father was a broken-down
retired official who has been sitting in a chair for the last three
years with his legs paralysed. The mamma she said was a sensible
woman. There is a son serving in the provinces but he doesnt help;
there is a daughter who is married but she doesnt visit them. And
theyve two little nephews on their hands as though their own children
were not enough and theyve taken from school their youngest daughter
a girl wholl be sixteen in another month so that then she can be
married. She was for me. We went there. How funny it was! I present
myself--a landowner a widower of a well-known name with connections
with a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks
of that? But its fascinating isnt it? It is fascinating ha-ha! You
should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying
to have seen me at that moment. She comes in curtseys you can fancy
still in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she had
been told no doubt. I dont know how you feel about female faces but
to my mind these sixteen years these childish eyes shyness and tears
of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little
picture too. Fair hair in little curls like a lambs full little rosy
lips tiny feet a charmer!... Well we made friends. I told them I was
in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances and the next day that is
the day before yesterday we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on
my knee at once and keep her there.... Well she flushes like a sunset
and I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her that
this is her husband and that this must be so. Its simply delicious! The
present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you
have what is called _la nature et la vrit_ ha-ha! Ive talked to her
twice she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me that
positively scorches me. Her face is like Raphaels Madonna. You know
the Sistine Madonnas face has something fantastic in it the face
of mournful religious ecstasy. Havent you noticed it? Well shes
something in that line. The day after wed been betrothed I bought her
presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and
another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this with all
sorts of things in it so that even my Madonnas face glowed. I sat her
on my knee yesterday and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--she
flushed crimson and the tears started but she didnt want to show it.
We were left alone she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first
time of her own accord) put her little arms round me kissed me and
vowed that she would be an obedient faithful and good wife would make
me happy would devote all her life every minute of her life would
sacrifice everything everything and that all she asks in return is
my _respect_ and that she wants nothing nothing more from me no
presents. Youll admit that to hear such a confession alone from an
angel of sixteen in a muslin frock with little curls with a flush
of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is
rather fascinating! Isnt it fascinating? Its worth paying for isnt
it? Well... listen well go to see my betrothed only not just now!

The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites
your sensuality! Will you really make such a marriage?

Why of course. Everyone thinks of himself and he lives most gaily who
knows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen about
virtue? Have mercy on me my good friend. I am a sinful man. Ha-ha-ha!

But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna. Though...
though you had your own reasons.... I understand it all now.

I am always fond of children very fond of them laughed Svidrigalov.
I can tell you one curious instance of it. The first day I came here I
visited various haunts after seven years I simply rushed at them. You
probably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my
old friends. I shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know when
I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country I was haunted by the thought
of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great
deal. Yes upon my soul! The peasants have vodka the educated young
people shut out from activity waste themselves in impossible dreams
and visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are
amassing money and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. From
the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to be
in a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance so called and
there was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes there you
have progress. All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen nicely
dressed dancing with a specialist in that line with another one
_vis--vis_. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You cant
fancy what a _cancan_ that was! The girl was ashamed blushed at
last felt insulted and began to cry. Her partner seized her and began
whirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--I
like your public even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted
Serves her right--serves her right! Shouldnt bring children! Well
its not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or
not. I at once fixed on my plan sat down by the mother and began by
saying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and
that they couldnt distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect
gave her to understand that I had plenty of money offered to take them
home in my carriage. I took them home and got to know them. They were
lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the
country. She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my
acquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of their
own and had come to town upon some legal business. I proffered my
services and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon
by mistake believing that it was a genuine dancing class. I offered to
assist in the young girls education in French and dancing. My offer was
accepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly.... If
you like well go and see them only not just now.

Stop! Enough of your vile nasty anecdotes depraved vile sensual
man!

Schiller you are a regular Schiller! _O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher?_
But you know I shall tell you these things on purpose for the pleasure
of hearing your outcries!

I dare say. I can see I am ridiculous myself muttered Raskolnikov
angrily.

Svidrigalov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip paid his bill
and began getting up.

I say but I am drunk _assez caus_ he said. Its been a pleasure.

I should rather think it must be a pleasure! cried Raskolnikov
getting up. No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to
describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in
his mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man as
me.... Its stimulating!

Well if you come to that Svidrigalov answered scrutinising
Raskolnikov with some surprise if you come to that you are a thorough
cynic yourself. Youve plenty to make you so anyway. You can understand
a great deal... and you can do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerely
regret not having had more talk with you but I shant lose sight of
you.... Only wait a bit.

Svidrigalov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov walked out after
him. Svidrigalov was not however very drunk the wine had affected him
for a moment but it was passing off every minute. He was preoccupied
with something of importance and was frowning. He was apparently excited
and uneasy in anticipation of something. His manner to Raskolnikov had
changed during the last few minutes and he was ruder and more sneering
every moment. Raskolnikov noticed all this and he too was uneasy. He
became very suspicious of Svidrigalov and resolved to follow him.

They came out on to the pavement.

You go to the right and I to the left or if you like the other way.
Only _adieu mon plaisir_ may we meet again.

And he walked to the right towards the Hay Market.



CHAPTER V

Raskolnikov walked after him.

Whats this? cried Svidrigalov turning round I thought I said...

It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now.

What?

Both stood still and gazed at one another as though measuring their
strength.

From all your half tipsy stories Raskolnikov observed harshly I am
_positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister but
are pursuing them more actively than ever. I have learnt that my sister
received a letter this morning. You have hardly been able to sit still
all this time.... You may have unearthed a wife on the way but that
means nothing. I should like to make certain myself.

Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he
wished to make certain.

Upon my word! Ill call the police!

Call away!

Again they stood for a minute facing each other. At last Svidrigalovs
face changed. Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not
frightened at his threat he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.

What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair
though I am devoured by curiosity. Its a fantastic affair. Ive put it
off till another time but youre enough to rouse the dead.... Well let
us go only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment
to get some money; then I shall lock up the flat take a cab and go to
spend the evening at the Islands. Now now are you going to follow me?

Im coming to your lodgings not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna to
say Im sorry not to have been at the funeral.

Thats as you like but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. She has taken
the three children to an old lady of high rank the patroness of some
orphan asylums whom I used to know years ago. I charmed the old lady by
depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of
Katerina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I told her
too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail suppressing nothing.
It produced an indescribable effect on her. Thats why Sofya Semyonovna
has been invited to call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is
staying for the time.

No matter Ill come all the same.

As you like its nothing to me but I wont come with you; here we are
at home. By the way I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion
just because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled
you with questions... you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I
dont mind betting its that. Well it teaches one to show delicacy!

And to listen at doors!

Ah thats it is it? laughed Svidrigalov. Yes I should have been
surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha!
Though I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and
were telling Sofya Semyonovna about what was the meaning of it? Perhaps
I am quite behind the times and cant understand. For goodness sake
explain it my dear boy. Expound the latest theories!

You couldnt have heard anything. Youre making it all up!

But Im not talking about that (though I did hear something). No Im
talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now. The Schiller in
you is in revolt every moment and now you tell me not to listen at
doors. If thats how you feel go and inform the police that you had
this mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory. But if you are
convinced that one mustnt listen at doors but one may murder old women
at ones pleasure youd better be off to America and make haste. Run
young man! There may still be time. Im speaking sincerely. Havent you
the money? Ill give you the fare.

Im not thinking of that at all Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust.

I understand (but dont put yourself out dont discuss it if you dont
want to). I understand the questions you are worrying over--moral ones
arent they? Duties of citizen and man? Lay them all aside. They are
nothing to you now ha-ha! Youll say you are still a man and a citizen.
If so you ought not to have got into this coil. Its no use taking up a
job you are not fit for. Well youd better shoot yourself or dont you
want to?

You seem trying to enrage me to make me leave you.

What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase. You
see thats the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look there is no one at home.
Dont you believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Here
is Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey what? She is rather deaf. Has she
gone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and wont be till late in
the evening probably. Well come to my room; you wanted to come and see
me didnt you? Here we are. Madame Resslichs not at home. She is a
woman who is always busy an excellent woman I assure you.... She might
have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. Now
see! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau--see what a lot
Ive got of them still--this one will be turned into cash to-day. I
mustnt waste any more time. The bureau is locked the flat is locked
and here we are again on the stairs. Shall we take a cab? Im going to
the Islands. Would you like a lift? Ill take this carriage. Ah you
refuse? You are tired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will come on
to rain. Never mind well put down the hood....

Svidrigalov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov decided that his
suspicions were at least for that moment unjust. Without answering a
word he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market. If he had only
turned round on his way he might have seen Svidrigalov get out not a
hundred paces off dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement. But he
had turned the corner and could see nothing. Intense disgust drew him
away from Svidrigalov.

To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that
coarse brute that depraved sensualist and blackguard! he cried.

Raskolnikovs judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was
something about Svidrigalov which gave him a certain original even a
mysterious character. As concerned his sister Raskolnikov was convinced
that Svidrigalov would not leave her in peace. But it was too tiresome
and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.

When he was alone he had not gone twenty paces before he sank as
usual into deep thought. On the bridge he stood by the railing and
began gazing at the water. And his sister was standing close by him.

He met her at the entrance to the bridge but passed by without seeing
her. Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was
struck with dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to call
to him or not. Suddenly she saw Svidrigalov coming quickly from the
direction of the Hay Market.

He seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go on to the
bridge but stood aside on the pavement doing all he could to avoid
Raskolnikovs seeing him. He had observed Dounia for some time and had
been making signs to her. She fancied he was signalling to beg her not
to speak to her brother but to come to him.

That was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and went up to
Svidrigalov.

Let us make haste away Svidrigalov whispered to her I dont want
Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. I must tell you Ive been
sitting with him in the restaurant close by where he looked me up and
I had great difficulty in getting rid of him. He has somehow heard of
my letter to you and suspects something. It wasnt you who told him of
course but if not you who then?

Well weve turned the corner now Dounia interrupted and my brother
wont see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.
Speak to me here. You can tell it all in the street.

In the first place I cant say it in the street; secondly you must
hear Sofya Semyonovna too; and thirdly I will show you some papers....
Oh well if you wont agree to come with me I shall refuse to give
any explanation and go away at once. But I beg you not to forget that
a very curious secret of your beloved brothers is entirely in my
keeping.

Dounia stood still hesitating and looked at Svidrigalov with
searching eyes.

What are you afraid of? he observed quietly. The town is not the
country. And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you.

Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?

No I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she
is at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmother
to-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time I
dont want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken
to you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like
this. I live there in that house we are coming to it. Thats the porter
of our house--he knows me very well; you see hes bowing; he sees Im
coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you
will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse
my putting things so coarsely. I havent a flat to myself; Sofya
Semyonovnas room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat. The
whole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child?
Am I really so terrible?

Svidrigalovs lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in
no smiling mood. His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.
He spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not
notice this peculiar excitement she was so irritated by his remark that
she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to
her.

Though I know that you are not a man... of honour I am not in the
least afraid of you. Lead the way she said with apparent composure
but her face was very pale.

Svidrigalov stopped at Sonias room.

Allow me to inquire whether she is at home.... She is not. How
unfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If shes gone out it
can only be to see a lady about the orphans. Their mother is dead....
Ive been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna
does not come back in ten minutes I will send her to you to-day if
you like. This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich
my landlady has the next room. Now look this way. I will show you
my chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two
perfectly empty rooms which are to let. Here they are... You must look
into them with some attention.

Svidrigalov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia was
looking about her mistrustfully but saw nothing special in the
furniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe
for instance that Svidrigalovs flat was exactly between two sets of
almost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly
from the passage but through the landladys two almost empty rooms.
Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom Svidrigalov showed Dounia
the two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway not
knowing what she was called to look upon but Svidrigalov hastened to
explain.

Look here at this second large room. Notice that door its locked.
By the door stands a chair the only one in the two rooms. I brought it
from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently. Just the other side of
the door is Sofya Semyonovnas table; she sat there talking to Rodion
Romanovitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings for
two hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something what
do you think?

You listened?

Yes I did. Now come back to my room; we cant sit down here.

He brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her
a chair. He sat down at the opposite side of the table at least seven
feet from her but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which
had once frightened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more looked
about her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she evidently
did not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded position of
Svidrigalovs lodging had suddenly struck her. She wanted to ask
whether his landlady at least were at home but pride kept her from
asking. Moreover she had another trouble in her heart incomparably
greater than fear for herself. She was in great distress.

Here is your letter she said laying it on the table. Can it be true
what you write? You hint at a crime committed you say by my brother.
You hint at it too clearly; you darent deny it now. I must tell you
that Id heard of this stupid story before you wrote and dont believe a
word of it. Its a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story
and why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You promised to
prove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I dont believe you! I dont
believe you!

Dounia said this speaking hurriedly and for an instant the colour
rushed to her face.

If you didnt believe it how could you risk coming alone to my rooms?
Why have you come? Simply from curiosity?

Dont torment me. Speak speak!

Theres no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word I thought
you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here. But he was not
with you nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. Its spirited of
you it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything
is divine in you.... About your brother what am I to say to you? Youve
just seen him yourself. What did you think of him?

Surely thats not the only thing you are building on?

No not on that but on his own words. He came here on two successive
evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. Ive shown you where they sat. He made
a full confession to her. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman a
pawnbroker with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed her sister
too a pedlar woman called Lizaveta who happened to come in while he
was murdering her sister. He killed them with an axe he brought with
him. He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them. He took money and
various things.... He told all this word for word to Sofya Semyonovna
the only person who knows his secret. But she has had no share by word
or deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now. Dont
be anxious she wont betray him.

It cannot be muttered Dounia with white lips. She gasped for breath.
It cannot be. There was not the slightest cause no sort of ground....
Its a lie a lie!

He robbed her that was the cause he took money and things. Its true
that by his own admission he made no use of the money or things but hid
them under a stone where they are now. But that was because he dared
not make use of them.

But how could he steal rob? How could he dream of it? cried Dounia
and she jumped up from the chair. Why you know him and youve seen
him can he be a thief?

She seemed to be imploring Svidrigalov; she had entirely forgotten her
fear.

There are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities
Avdotya Romanovna. A thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel but Ive
heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail. Who knows very likely he
thought he was doing a gentlemanly thing! Of course I should not have
believed it myself if Id been told of it as you have but I believe my
own ears. He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too but
she did not believe her ears at first yet she believed her own eyes at
last.

What... were the causes?

Its a long story Avdotya Romanovna. Heres... how shall I tell
you?--A theory of a sort the same one by which I for instance consider
that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right a
solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds! Its galling too of
course for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if
he had for instance a paltry three thousand his whole career his
whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three
thousand. Add to that nervous irritability from hunger from lodging
in a hole from rags from a vivid sense of the charm of his social
position and his sisters and mothers position too. Above all vanity
pride and vanity though goodness knows he may have good qualities
too.... I am not blaming him please dont think it; besides its not
my business. A special little theory came in too--a theory of a
sort--dividing mankind you see into material and superior persons
that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their
superiority who make laws for the rest of mankind the material that
is. Its all right as a theory _une thorie comme une autre_. Napoleon
attracted him tremendously that is what affected him was that a
great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing but have
overstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied
that he was a genius too--that is he was convinced of it for a time. He
has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he
could make a theory but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law
and so he is not a man of genius. And thats humiliating for a young man
of any pride in our day especially....

But remorse? You deny him any moral feeling then? Is he like that?

Ah Avdotya Romanovna everything is in a muddle now; not that it was
ever in very good order. Russians in general are broad in their ideas
Avdotya Romanovna broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to
the fantastic the chaotic. But its a misfortune to be broad without
a special genius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on
this subject sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper? Why
you used to reproach me with breadth! Who knows perhaps we were talking
at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan. There
are no sacred traditions amongst us especially in the educated class
Avdotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up somehow for
himself out of books or from some old chronicle. But those are for the
most part the learned and all old fogeys so that it would be almost
ill-bred in a man of society. You know my opinions in general though. I
never blame anyone. I do nothing at all I persevere in that. But
weve talked of this more than once before. I was so happy indeed as to
interest you in my opinions.... You are very pale Avdotya Romanovna.

I know his theory. I read that article of his about men to whom all is
permitted. Razumihin brought it to me.

Mr. Razumihin? Your brothers article? In a magazine? Is there such an
article? I didnt know. It must be interesting. But where are you going
Avdotya Romanovna?

I want to see Sofya Semyonovna Dounia articulated faintly. How do I
go to her? She has come in perhaps. I must see her at once. Perhaps
she...

Avdotya Romanovna could not finish. Her breath literally failed her.

Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night at least I believe not.
She was to have been back at once but if not then she will not be in
till quite late.

Ah then you are lying! I see... you were lying... lying all the
time.... I dont believe you! I dont believe you! cried Dounia
completely losing her head.

Almost fainting she sank on to a chair which Svidrigalov made haste to
give her.

Avdotya Romanovna what is it? Control yourself! Here is some water.
Drink a little....

He sprinkled some water over her. Dounia shuddered and came to herself.

It has acted violently Svidrigalov muttered to himself frowning.
Avdotya Romanovna calm yourself! Believe me he has friends. We will
save him. Would you like me to take him abroad? I have money I can get
a ticket in three days. And as for the murder he will do all sorts of
good deeds yet to atone for it. Calm yourself. He may become a great
man yet. Well how are you? How do you feel?

Cruel man! To be able to jeer at it! Let me go...

Where are you going?

To him. Where is he? Do you know? Why is this door locked? We came in
at that door and now it is locked. When did you manage to lock it?

We couldnt be shouting all over the flat on such a subject. I am far
from jeering; its simply that Im sick of talking like this. But how
can you go in such a state? Do you want to betray him? You will drive
him to fury and he will give himself up. Let me tell you he is already
being watched; they are already on his track. You will simply be giving
him away. Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now. He
can still be saved. Wait a bit sit down; let us think it over together.
I asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to
consider it thoroughly. But do sit down!

How can you save him? Can he really be saved?

Dounia sat down. Svidrigalov sat down beside her.

It all depends on you on you on you alone he began with glowing
eyes almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for
emotion.

Dounia drew back from him in alarm. He too was trembling all over.

You... one word from you and he is saved. I... Ill save him. I have
money and friends. Ill send him away at once. Ill get a passport
two passports one for him and one for me. I have friends... capable
people.... If you like Ill take a passport for you... for your
mother.... What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too.... I love
you beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress let me let
me.... The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me do that
and Ill do it. Ill do everything. I will do the impossible. What you
believe I will believe. Ill do anything--anything! Dont dont look
at me like that. Do you know that you are killing me?...

He was almost beginning to rave.... Something seemed suddenly to go to
his head. Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door.

Open it! Open it! she called shaking the door. Open it! Is there no
one there?

Svidrigalov got up and came to himself. His still trembling lips slowly
broke into an angry mocking smile.

There is no one at home he said quietly and emphatically. The
landlady has gone out and its waste of time to shout like that. You
are only exciting yourself uselessly.

Where is the key? Open the door at once at once base man!

I have lost the key and cannot find it.

This is an outrage cried Dounia turning pale as death. She rushed
to the furthest corner where she made haste to barricade herself with a
little table.

She did not scream but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched
every movement he made.

Svidrigalov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.
He was positively composed at least in appearance but his face was
pale as before. The mocking smile did not leave his face.

You spoke of outrage just now Avdotya Romanovna. In that case you
may be sure Ive taken measures. Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. The
Kapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between. I am at
least twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear besides.
For you could not complain afterwards. You surely would not be willing
actually to betray your brother? Besides no one would believe you. How
should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?
So that even if you do sacrifice your brother you could prove nothing.
It is very difficult to prove an assault Avdotya Romanovna.

Scoundrel! whispered Dounia indignantly.

As you like but observe I was only speaking by way of a general
proposition. Its my personal conviction that you are perfectly
right--violence is hateful. I only spoke to show you that you need have
no remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your
own accord as I suggest to you. You would be simply submitting to
circumstances to violence in fact if we must use that word. Think
about it. Your brothers and your mothers fate are in your hands. I
will be your slave... all my life... I will wait here.

Svidrigalov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia. She had
not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination. Besides she
knew him. Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver cocked it
and laid it in her hand on the table. Svidrigalov jumped up.

Aha! So thats it is it? he cried surprised but smiling maliciously.
Well that completely alters the aspect of affairs. Youve made things
wonderfully easier for me Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the
revolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why its my revolver an old friend!
And how Ive hunted for it! The shooting lessons Ive given you in the
country have not been thrown away.

Its not your revolver it belonged to Marfa Petrovna whom you killed
wretch! There was nothing of yours in her house. I took it when I began
to suspect what you were capable of. If you dare to advance one step I
swear Ill kill you. She was frantic.

But your brother? I ask from curiosity said Svidrigalov still
standing where he was.

Inform if you want to! Dont stir! Dont come nearer! Ill shoot! You
poisoned your wife I know; you are a murderer yourself! She held the
revolver ready.

Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?

You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison.... I know
you went to get it... you had it in readiness.... It was your doing....
It must have been your doing.... Scoundrel!

Even if that were true it would have been for your sake... you would
have been the cause.

You are lying! I hated you always always....

Oho Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten how you softened
to me in the heat of propaganda. I saw it in your eyes. Do you remember
that moonlight night when the nightingale was singing?

Thats a lie there was a flash of fury in Dounias eyes thats a
lie and a libel!

A lie? Well if you like its a lie. I made it up. Women ought not
to be reminded of such things he smiled. I know you will shoot you
pretty wild creature. Well shoot away!

Dounia raised the revolver and deadly pale gazed at him measuring the
distance and awaiting the first movement on his part. Her lower lip was
white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. He had
never seen her so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment
she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of
anguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a shot rang out. The
bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. He stood still and
laughed softly.

The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. Whats this?
Blood? he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood which flowed
in a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have just
grazed the skin.

Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigalov not so much in
terror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand what
she was doing and what was going on.

Well you missed! Fire again Ill wait said Svidrigalov softly
still smiling but gloomily. If you go on like that I shall have time
to seize you before you cock again.

Dounia started quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.

Let me be she cried in despair. I swear Ill shoot again. I... Ill
kill you.

Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you dont...
then. His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shot
again: it missed fire.

You havent loaded it properly. Never mind you have another charge
there. Get it ready Ill wait.

He stood facing her two paces away waiting and gazing at her with wild
determination with feverishly passionate stubborn set eyes. Dounia
saw that he would sooner die than let her go. And... now of course she
would kill him at two paces! Suddenly she flung away the revolver.

Shes dropped it! said Svidrigalov with surprise and he drew a deep
breath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only
the fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.
It was the deliverance from another feeling darker and more bitter
which he could not himself have defined.

He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not
resist but trembling like a leaf looked at him with suppliant eyes.
He tried to say something but his lips moved without being able to
utter a sound.

Let me go Dounia implored. Svidrigalov shuddered. Her voice now was
quite different.

Then you dont love me? he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.

And... and you cant? Never? he whispered in despair.

Never!

There followed a moment of terrible dumb struggle in the heart of
Svidrigalov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly
he withdrew his arm turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.
Another moment passed.

Heres the key.

He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table
behind him without turning or looking at Dounia.

Take it! Make haste!

He looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to
take the key.

Make haste! Make haste! repeated Svidrigalov still without turning
or moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that
make haste.

Dounia understood it snatched up the key flew to the door unlocked it
quickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later beside herself she
ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.

Svidrigalov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he
slowly turned looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A
strange smile contorted his face a pitiful sad weak smile a smile of
despair. The blood which was already getting dry smeared his hand.
He looked angrily at it then wetted a towel and washed his temple.
The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly
caught his eye. He picked it up and examined it. It was a little pocket
three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still
two charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He
thought a little put the revolver in his pocket took his hat and went
out.



CHAPTER VI

He spent that evening till ten oclock going from one low haunt to
another. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song how a certain

villain and tyrant

began kissing Katia.

Svidrigalov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and
the waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these
clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses one bent to the
left and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure
garden where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky
three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden besides a
Vauxhall which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was
served and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.
A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed
German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The
clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.
Svidrigalov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for
a quarter of an hour but they shouted so loud that there was no
possibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was
that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in
selling it on the spot to a Jew but would not share the spoil with his
companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon
belonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem
troublesome. Svidrigalov paid for the spoon got up and walked out of
the garden. It was about six oclock. He had not drunk a drop of wine
all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than
anything.

It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over
the sky about ten oclock. There was a clap of thunder and the rain
came down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops but beat on the
earth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each
flash lasted while one could count five.

Drenched to the skin he went home locked himself in opened the
bureau took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then
putting the money in his pocket he was about to change his clothes
but looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the
rain he gave up the idea took up his hat and went out of the room
without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.

She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She
was giving them tea. She received Svidrigalov in respectful silence
looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at
once in indescribable terror.

Svidrigalov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.
She timidly prepared to listen.

I may be going to America Sofya Semyonovna said Svidrigalov and
as I am probably seeing you for the last time I have come to make some
arrangements. Well did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to
you you need not tell me. (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) Those
people have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your
brother they are really provided for and the money assigned to them
Ive put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had
better take charge of the receipts in case anything happens. Here take
them! Well now thats settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the
value of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself entirely for
yourself and let that be strictly between ourselves so that no one
knows of it whatever you hear. You will need the money for to go on
living in the old way Sofya Semyonovna is bad and besides there is no
need for it now.

I am so much indebted to you and so are the children and my
stepmother said Sonia hurriedly and if Ive said so little... please
dont consider...

Thats enough! thats enough!

But as for the money Arkady Ivanovitch I am very grateful to you
but I dont need it now. I can always earn my own living. Dont think me
ungrateful. If you are so charitable that money....

Its for you for you Sofya Semyonovna and please dont waste words
over it. I havent time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch
has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia. (Sonia looked
wildly at him and started.) Dont be uneasy I know all about it from
himself and I am not a gossip; I wont tell anyone. It was good advice
when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much
better for him. Well if it turns out to be Siberia he will go and
you will follow him. Thats so isnt it? And if so youll need money.
Youll need it for him do you understand? Giving it to you is the same
as my giving it to him. Besides you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay
whats owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so
heedlessly Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovnas debt and not
yours so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.
You cant get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned
about me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--dont say
anything about my coming to see you now and dont show the money to
anyone or say a word about it. Well now good-bye. (He got up.) My
greetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way youd better put the money
for the present in Mr. Razumihins keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of
course you do. Hes not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or...
when the time comes. And till then hide it carefully.

Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigalov.
She longed to speak to ask a question but for the first moments she
did not dare and did not know how to begin.

How can you... how can you be going now in such rain?

Why be starting for America and be stopped by rain! Ha ha! Good-bye
Sofya Semyonovna my dear! Live and live long you will be of use to
others. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.
Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigalov sends his greetings. Be sure
to.

He went out leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague
apprehension.

It appeared afterwards that on the same evening at twenty past eleven
he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still
persisted. Drenched to the skin he walked into the little flat where
the parents of his betrothed lived in Third Street in Vassilyevsky
Island. He knocked some time before he was admitted and his visit
at first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigalov could be
very fascinating when he liked so that the first and indeed very
intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigalov had
probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing
vanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see
Svidrigalov by the tender and sensible mother who as usual began the
conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct
question but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then if she
were obliged to ascertain something--for instance when Svidrigalov
would like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and
almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there and only
by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other
occasions this had of course been very impressive but this time Arkady
Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient and insisted on seeing his
betrothed at once though he had been informed to begin with that she
had already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.

Svidrigalov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important
affairs to leave Petersburg for a time and therefore brought her
fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from
him as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present
before their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his
immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that
purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went
off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret
the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the
other hand the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced
by tears from the most sensible of mothers. Svidrigalov got up
laughed kissed his betrothed patted her cheek declared he would soon
come back and noticing in her eyes together with childish curiosity a
sort of earnest dumb inquiry reflected and kissed her again though
he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be
immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He
went away leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement but
the tender mamma speaking quietly in a half whisper settled some of
the most important of their doubts concluding that Svidrigalov was
a great man a man of great affairs and connections and of great
wealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start
off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him so that
there was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he
was wet through but Englishmen for instance are even more eccentric
and all these people of high society didnt think of what was said of
them and didnt stand on ceremony. Possibly indeed he came like that
on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all not a
word should be said about it for God knows what might come of it and
the money must be locked up and it was most fortunate that Fedosya the
cook had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said
to that old cat Madame Resslich and so on and so on. They sat up
whispering till two oclock but the girl went to bed much earlier
amazed and rather sorrowful.

Svidrigalov meanwhile exactly at midnight crossed the bridge on the
way back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring
wind. He began shivering and for one moment he gazed at the black
waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest even inquiry.
But he soon felt it very cold standing by the water; he turned and
went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long
time almost half an hour more than once stumbling in the dark on the
wooden pavement but continually looking for something on the right side
of the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that
there was a hotel somewhere towards the end built of wood but fairly
large and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was
not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place
that he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long
blackened wooden building and in spite of the late hour there were
lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked
a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter
scanning Svidrigalov pulled himself together and led him at once to a
close and tiny room in the distance at the end of the corridor under
the stairs. There was no other all were occupied. The ragged fellow
looked inquiringly.

Is there tea? asked Svidrigalov.

Yes sir.

What else is there?

Veal vodka savouries.

Bring me tea and veal.

And you want nothing else? he asked with apparent surprise.

Nothing nothing.

The ragged man went away completely disillusioned.

It must be a nice place thought Svidrigalov. How was it I didnt
know it? I expect I look as if I came from a caf chantant and have
had some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stayed
here?

He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a
room so low-pitched that Svidrigalov could only just stand up in it;
it had one window; the bed which was very dirty and the plain-stained
chair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they
were made of planks covered with shabby paper so torn and dusty
that the pattern was indistinguishable though the general
colour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short
by the sloping ceiling though the room was not an attic but just under
the stairs.

Svidrigalov set down the candle sat down on the bed and sank into
thought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout
in the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from
the moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and
almost tearfully scolding but he heard only one voice.

Svidrigalov got up shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw
light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The
room which was somewhat larger than his had two occupants. One of
them a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face was standing
in the pose of an orator without his coat with his legs wide apart to
preserve his balance and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached
the other with being a beggar with having no standing whatever. He
declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn
him out when he liked and that only the finger of Providence sees it
all. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair and had the
air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze but cant. He sometimes
turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker but obviously had not
the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A
candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses a nearly
empty bottle of vodka bread and cucumber and glasses with the dregs
of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this Svidrigalov turned away
indifferently and sat down on the bed.

The ragged attendant returning with the tea could not resist asking
him again whether he didnt want anything more and again receiving a
negative reply finally withdrew. Svidrigalov made haste to drink a
glass of tea to warm himself but could not eat anything. He began
to feel feverish. He took off his coat and wrapping himself in the
blanket lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. It would have been better
to be well for the occasion he thought with a smile. The room was
close the candle burnt dimly the wind was roaring outside he heard
a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of
leather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He
felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. It must be a garden
under the window he thought. Theres a sound of trees. How I dislike
the sound of trees on a stormy night in the dark! They give one a
horrid feeling. He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed
Petrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little
Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. I never have
liked water he thought even in a landscape and he suddenly smiled
again at a strange idea: Surely now all these questions of taste and
comfort ought not to matter but Ive become more particular like an
animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought
to have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark cold
ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way why
havent I put out the candle? he blew it out. Theyve gone to bed next
door he thought not seeing the light at the crack. Well now Marfa
Petrovna now is the time for you to turn up; its dark and the very
time and place for you. But now you wont come!

He suddenly recalled how an hour before carrying out his design on
Dounia he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihins
keeping. I suppose I really did say it as Raskolnikov guessed to
tease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! Hes gone through a
good deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when hes got over
his nonsense. But now hes _too_ eager for life. These young men
are contemptible on that point. But hang the fellow! Let him please
himself its nothing to do with me.

He could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounias image rose before him
and a shudder ran over him. No I must give up all that now he
thought rousing himself. I must think of something else. Its queer
and funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone I never particularly
desired to avenge myself even and thats a bad sign a bad sign a bad
sign. I never liked quarrelling either and never lost my temper--thats
a bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now too--Damnation!
But--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me
somehow....

He ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dounias image
rose before him just as she was when after shooting the first time
she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him so that
he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand
to defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that
instant he felt almost sorry for her how he had felt a pang at his
heart...

Ae! Damnation these thoughts again! I must put it away!

He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased when suddenly
something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He
started. Ugh! hang it! I believe its a mouse he thought thats the
veal I left on the table. He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the
blanket get up get cold but all at once something unpleasant ran over
his leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking
with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.
He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.
He tried to catch it but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without
leaving the bed slipped between his fingers ran over his hand and
suddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow but in one
instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down
his back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.

The room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket
as before. The wind was howling under the window. How disgusting he
thought with annoyance.

He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the
window. Its better not to sleep at all he decided. There was a cold
damp draught from the window however; without getting up he drew the
blanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of
anything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another
incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his
mind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold or the dampness or
the dark or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees
roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling
on images of flowers he fancied a charming flower garden a bright
warm almost hot day a holiday--Trinity day. A fine sumptuous country
cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers with
flower beds going round the house; the porch wreathed in climbers was
surrounded with beds of roses. A light cool staircase carpeted with
rich rugs was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed
particularly in the windows nosegays of tender white heavily fragrant
narcissus bending over their bright green thick long stalks. He was
reluctant to move away from them but he went up the stairs and came
into a large high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows
the doors on to the balcony and on the balcony itself--were flowers.
The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay the windows
were open a fresh cool light air came into the room. The birds were
chirruping under the window and in the middle of the room on a table
covered with a white satin shroud stood a coffin. The coffin was
covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of
flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a
white muslin dress with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom as
though carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was
a wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of
her face looked as though chiselled of marble too and the smile on her
pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.
Svidrigalov knew that girl; there was no holy image no burning candle
beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.
She was only fourteen but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed
herself crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish
soul had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn
from her a last scream of despair unheeded and brutally disregarded on
a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....

Svidrigalov came to himself got up from the bed and went to the
window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously
into the little room and stung his face and his chest only covered with
his shirt as though with frost. Under the window there must have been
something like a garden and apparently a pleasure garden. There too
probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of
rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as
in a cellar so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of
objects. Svidrigalov bending down with elbows on the window-sill
gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon followed
by a second one resounded in the darkness of the night. Ah the
signal! The river is overflowing he thought. By morning it will be
swirling down the street in the lower parts flooding the basements and
cellars. The cellar rats will swim out and men will curse in the rain
and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is
it now? And he had hardly thought it when somewhere near a clock on
the wall ticking away hurriedly struck three.

Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? Ill go out at once
straight to the park. Ill choose a great bush there drenched with rain
so that as soon as ones shoulder touches it millions of drops drip on
ones head.

He moved away from the window shut it lighted the candle put on his
waistcoat his overcoat and his hat and went out carrying the candle
into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep
somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish to pay
him for the room and leave the hotel. Its the best minute; I couldnt
choose a better.

He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding
anyone and was just going to call out when suddenly in a dark corner
between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object
which seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little
girl not more than five years old shivering and crying with her
clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of
Svidrigalov but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big
black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been
crying a long time but are beginning to be comforted. The childs face
was pale and tired she was numb with cold. How can she have come here?
She must have hidden here and not slept all night. He began questioning
her. The child suddenly becoming animated chattered away in her baby
language something about mammy and that mammy would beat her and
about some cup that she had bwoken. The child chattered on without
stopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a
neglected child whose mother probably a drunken cook in the service
of the hotel whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken
a cup of her mothers and was so frightened that she had run away the
evening before had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the
rain at last had made her way in here hidden behind the cupboard and
spent the night there crying and trembling from the damp the darkness
and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his
arms went back to his room sat her on the bed and began undressing
her. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as
wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had
undressed her he put her on the bed covered her up and wrapped her in
the blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he
sank into dreary musing again.

What folly to trouble myself he decided suddenly with an oppressive
feeling of annoyance. What idiocy! In vexation he took up the candle
to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.
Damn the child! he thought as he opened the door but he turned again
to see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.
The child was sleeping soundly she had got warm under the blanket
and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed
brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. Its a flush
of fever thought Svidrigalov. It was like the flush from drinking as
though she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were
hot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long
black eyelashes were quivering as though the lids were opening and a
sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink as though the little
girl were not asleep but pretending. Yes it was so. Her lips parted in
a smile. The corners of her mouth quivered as though she were trying to
control them. But now she quite gave up all effort now it was a grin
a broad grin; there was something shameless provocative in that quite
unchildish face; it was depravity it was the face of a harlot the
shameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they
turned a glowing shameless glance upon him; they laughed invited
him.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that
laugh in those eyes in such nastiness in the face of a child. What
at five years old? Svidrigalov muttered in genuine horror. What does
it mean? And now she turned to him her little face all aglow holding
out her arms.... Accursed child! Svidrigalov cried raising his hand
to strike her but at that moment he woke up.

He was in the same bed still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not
been lighted and daylight was streaming in at the windows.

Ive had nightmare all night! He got up angrily feeling utterly
shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could
see nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up
put on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his
pocket he took it out and then he sat down took a notebook out of his
pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few
lines in large letters. Reading them over he sank into thought with his
elbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some
flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal which was still on
the table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began
trying to catch one. He tried till he was tired but could not catch it.
At last realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit he
started got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he
was in the street.

A thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigalov walked along the
slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing
the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night Petrovsky Island
the wet paths the wet grass the wet trees and bushes and at last the
bush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses trying to think
of something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.
The bright yellow wooden little houses looked dirty and dejected with
their closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and
he began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read
each carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and
came to a big stone house. A dirty shivering dog crossed his path with
its tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead
drunk across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower
stood up on the left. Bah! he shouted here is a place. Why should
it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness
anyway....

He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where
there was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of
the house a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them
wrapped in a grey soldiers coat with a copper Achilles helmet on his
head. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigalov. His
face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection which is so sourly
printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both
Svidrigalov and Achilles stared at each other for a few minutes
without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man
not drunk to be standing three steps from him staring and not saying a
word.

What do you want here? he said without moving or changing his
position.

Nothing brother good morning answered Svidrigalov.

This isnt the place.

I am going to foreign parts brother.

To foreign parts?

To America.

America.

Svidrigalov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised his
eyebrows.

I say this is not the place for such jokes!

Why shouldnt it be the place?

Because it isnt.

Well brother I dont mind that. Its a good place. When you are
asked you just say he was going he said to America.

He put the revolver to his right temple.

You cant do it here its not the place cried Achilles rousing
himself his eyes growing bigger and bigger.

Svidrigalov pulled the trigger.



CHAPTER VII

The same day about seven oclock in the evening Raskolnikov was on
his way to his mothers and sisters lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyevs
house which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from
the street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps as though still
hesitating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned him back:
his decision was taken.

Besides it doesnt matter they still know nothing he thought and
they are used to thinking of me as eccentric.

He was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty soaked with a
nights rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue exposure the
inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all
the previous night alone God knows where. But anyway he had reached a
decision.

He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was not
at home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first Pulcheria
Alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by
the hand and drew him into the room.

Here you are! she began faltering with joy. Dont be angry with
me Rodya for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not
crying. Did you think I was crying? No I am delighted but Ive got
into such a stupid habit of shedding tears. Ive been like that ever
since your fathers death. I cry for anything. Sit down dear boy you
must be tired; I see you are. Ah how muddy you are.

I was in the rain yesterday mother.... Raskolnikov began.

No no Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted you thought I
was going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; dont be
anxious I understand I understand it all: now Ive learned the ways
here and truly I see for myself that they are better. Ive made up my
mind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to
give an account of them? God knows what concerns and plans you may have
or what ideas you are hatching; so its not for me to keep nudging your
elbow asking you what you are thinking about? But my goodness! why
am I running to and fro as though I were crazy...? I am reading your
article in the magazine for the third time Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch
brought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: There
foolish one I thought thats what he is busy about; thats the
solution of the mystery! Learned people are always like that. He may
have some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I
worry him and upset him. I read it my dear and of course there was a
great deal I did not understand; but thats only natural--how should I?

Show me mother.

Raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article. Incongruous
as it was with his mood and his circumstances he felt that strange and
bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he
sees himself in print; besides he was only twenty-three. It lasted only
a moment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed
with anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding
months. He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.

But however foolish I may be Rodya I can see for myself that you
will very soon be one of the leading--if not the leading man--in the
world of Russian thought. And they dared to think you were mad! You
dont know but they really thought that. Ah the despicable creatures
how could they understand genius! And Dounia Dounia was all but
believing it--what do you say to that? Your father sent twice to
magazines--the first time poems (Ive got the manuscript and will show
you) and the second time a whole novel (I begged him to let me copy it
out) and how we prayed that they should be taken--they werent! I was
breaking my heart Rodya six or seven days ago over your food and your
clothes and the way you are living. But now I see again how foolish
I was for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and
talent. No doubt you dont care about that for the present and you are
occupied with much more important matters....

Dounias not at home mother?

No Rodya. I often dont see her; she leaves me alone. Dmitri
Prokofitch comes to see me its so good of him and he always talks
about you. He loves you and respects you my dear. I dont say that
Dounia is very wanting in consideration. I am not complaining. She has
her ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and
I never have any secrets from you two. Of course I am sure that Dounia
has far too much sense and besides she loves you and me... but I dont
know what it will all lead to. Youve made me so happy by coming now
Rodya but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in Ill tell
her: Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you been all
this time? You mustnt spoil me Rodya you know; come when you can
but if you cant it doesnt matter I can wait. I shall know anyway
that you are fond of me that will be enough for me. I shall read what
you write I shall hear about you from everyone and sometimes youll
come yourself to see me. What could be better? Here youve come now to
comfort your mother I see that.

Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.

Here I am again! Dont mind my foolishness. My goodness why am I
sitting here? she cried jumping up. There is coffee and I dont offer
you any. Ah thats the selfishness of old age. Ill get it at once!

Mother dont trouble I am going at once. I havent come for that.
Please listen to me.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.

Mother whatever happens whatever you hear about me whatever you are
told about me will you always love me as you do now? he asked suddenly
from the fullness of his heart as though not thinking of his words and
not weighing them.

Rodya Rodya what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question?
Why who will tell me anything about you? Besides I shouldnt believe
anyone I should refuse to listen.

Ive come to assure you that Ive always loved you and I am glad
that we are alone even glad Dounia is out he went on with the same
impulse. I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy you
must believe that your son loves you now more than himself and that all
you thought about me that I was cruel and didnt care about you was
all a mistake. I shall never cease to love you.... Well thats enough:
I thought I must do this and begin with this....

Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence pressing him to her
bosom and weeping gently.

I dont know what is wrong with you Rodya she said at last. Ive
been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see
that there is a great sorrow in store for you and thats why you are
miserable. Ive foreseen it a long time Rodya. Forgive me for speaking
about it. I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sister
lay talking in her sleep all last night talking of nothing but you. I
caught something but I couldnt make it out. I felt all the morning
as though I were going to be hanged waiting for something expecting
something and now it has come! Rodya Rodya where are you going? You
are going away somewhere?

Yes.

Thats what I thought! I can come with you you know if you need
me. And Dounia too; she loves you she loves you dearly--and Sofya
Semyonovna may come with us if you like. You see I am glad to look upon
her as a daughter even... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together.
But... where... are you going?

Good-bye mother.

What to-day? she cried as though losing him for ever.

I cant stay I must go now....

And cant I come with you?

No but kneel down and pray to God for me. Your prayer perhaps will
reach Him.

Let me bless you and sign you with the cross. Thats right thats
right. Oh God what are we doing?

Yes he was glad he was very glad that there was no one there that
he was alone with his mother. For the first time after all those awful
months his heart was softened. He fell down before her he kissed her
feet and both wept embracing. And she was not surprised and did not
question him this time. For some days she had realised that something
awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had
come for him.

Rodya my darling my first born she said sobbing now you are just
as when you were little. You would run like this to me and hug me and
kiss me. When your father was living and we were poor you comforted us
simply by being with us and when I buried your father how often we
wept together at his grave and embraced as now. And if Ive been crying
lately its that my mothers heart had a foreboding of trouble. The
first time I saw you that evening you remember as soon as we arrived
here I guessed simply from your eyes. My heart sank at once and to-day
when I opened the door and looked at you I thought the fatal hour had
come. Rodya Rodya you are not going away to-day?

No!

Youll come again?

Yes... Ill come.

Rodya dont be angry I dont dare to question you. I know I mustnt.
Only say two words to me--is it far where you are going?

Very far.

What is awaiting you there? Some post or career for you?

What God sends... only pray for me. Raskolnikov went to the door but
she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes. Her face worked
with terror.

Enough mother said Raskolnikov deeply regretting that he had come.

Not for ever its not yet for ever? Youll come youll come
to-morrow?

I will I will good-bye. He tore himself away at last.

It was a warm fresh bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.
Raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste. He wanted to finish all
before sunset. He did not want to meet anyone till then. Going up the
stairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him
intently. Can anyone have come to see me? he wondered. He had a
disgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw Dounia. She
was sitting alone plunged in deep thought and looked as though she had
been waiting a long time. He stopped short in the doorway. She rose from
the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him. Her eyes fixed upon him
betrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes alone he saw at
once that she knew.

Am I to come in or go away? he asked uncertainly.

Ive been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you.
We thought that you would be sure to come there.

Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair.

I feel weak Dounia I am very tired; and I should have liked at this
moment to be able to control myself.

He glanced at her mistrustfully.

Where were you all night?

I dont remember clearly. You see sister I wanted to make up my mind
once for all and several times I walked by the Neva I remember that
I wanted to end it all there but... I couldnt make up my mind he
whispered looking at her mistrustfully again.

Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of Sofya Semyonovna and
I. Then you still have faith in life? Thank God thank God!

Raskolnikov smiled bitterly.

I havent faith but I have just been weeping in mothers arms; I
havent faith but I have just asked her to pray for me. I dont know
how it is Dounia I dont understand it.

Have you been at mothers? Have you told her? cried Dounia
horror-stricken. Surely you havent done that?

No I didnt tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal.
She heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure she half understands it
already. Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her. I dont know why I did
go. I am a contemptible person Dounia.

A contemptible person but ready to face suffering! You are arent
you?

Yes I am going. At once. Yes to escape the disgrace I thought of
drowning myself Dounia but as I looked into the water I thought that
if I had considered myself strong till now Id better not be afraid of
disgrace he said hurrying on. Its pride Dounia.

Pride Rodya.

There was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad
to think that he was still proud.

You dont think sister that I was simply afraid of the water? he
asked looking into her face with a sinister smile.

Oh Rodya hush! cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted for two
minutes. He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the
other end of the table and looked at him with anguish. Suddenly he got
up.

Its late its time to go! I am going at once to give myself up. But I
dont know why I am going to give myself up.

Big tears fell down her cheeks.

You are crying sister but can you hold out your hand to me?

You doubted it?

She threw her arms round him.

Arent you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering? she
cried holding him close and kissing him.

Crime? What crime? he cried in sudden fury. That I killed a vile
noxious insect an old pawnbroker woman of use to no one!... Killing
her was atonement for forty sins. She was sucking the life out of poor
people. Was that a crime? I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking
of expiating it and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? A
crime! a crime! Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice
now that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace. Its simply
because I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to
perhaps too for my advantage as that... Porfiry... suggested!

Brother brother what are you saying? Why you have shed blood? cried
Dounia in despair.

Which all men shed he put in almost frantically which flows and has
always flowed in streams which is spilt like champagne and for which
men are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of
mankind. Look into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted to
do good to men and would have done hundreds thousands of good deeds
to make up for that one piece of stupidity not stupidity even simply
clumsiness for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now
that it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid when it fails.) By that
stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position to
take the first step to obtain means and then everything would have
been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I...
I couldnt carry out even the first step because I am contemptible
thats whats the matter! And yet I wont look at it as you do. If I had
succeeded I should have been crowned with glory but now Im trapped.

But thats not so not so! Brother what are you saying?

Ah its not picturesque not sthetically attractive! I fail to
understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable.
The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence. Ive never
never recognised this more clearly than now and I am further than ever
from seeing that what I did was a crime. Ive never never been stronger
and more convinced than now.

The colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face but as he uttered
his last explanation he happened to meet Dounias eyes and he saw such
anguish in them that he could not help being checked. He felt that he
had anyway made these two poor women miserable that he was anyway
the cause...

Dounia darling if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgiven
if I am guilty). Good-bye! We wont dispute. Its time high time to go.
Dont follow me I beseech you I have somewhere else to go.... But you
go at once and sit with mother. I entreat you to! Its my last request
of you. Dont leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety that
she is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind. Be with
her! Razumihin will be with you. Ive been talking to him.... Dont cry
about me: Ill try to be honest and manly all my life even if I am a
murderer. Perhaps I shall some day make a name. I wont disgrace you
you will see; Ill still show.... Now good-bye for the present he
concluded hurriedly noticing again a strange expression in Dounias
eyes at his last words and promises. Why are you crying? Dont cry
dont cry: we are not parting for ever! Ah yes! Wait a minute Id
forgotten!

He went to the table took up a thick dusty book opened it and took
from between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory. It was
the portrait of his landladys daughter who had died of fever that
strange girl who had wanted to be a nun. For a minute he gazed at the
delicate expressive face of his betrothed kissed the portrait and gave
it to Dounia.

I used to talk a great deal about it to her only to her he said
thoughtfully. To her heart I confided much of what has since been so
hideously realised. Dont be uneasy he returned to Dounia she was
as much opposed to it as you and I am glad that she is gone. The great
point is that everything now is going to be different is going to
be broken in two he cried suddenly returning to his dejection.
Everything everything and am I prepared for it? Do I want it myself?
They say it is necessary for me to suffer! Whats the object of these
senseless sufferings? shall I know any better what they are for when I
am crushed by hardships and idiocy and weak as an old man after twenty
years penal servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I
consenting to that life now? Oh I knew I was contemptible when I stood
looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!

At last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia but she loved him.
She walked away but after going fifty paces she turned round to look
at him again. He was still in sight. At the corner he too turned and for
the last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him
he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation and turned the
corner abruptly.

I am wicked I see that he thought to himself feeling ashamed a
moment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. But why are they so fond
of me if I dont deserve it? Oh if only I were alone and no one loved
me and I too had never loved anyone! _Nothing of all this would have
happened._ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so
meek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word
that I am a criminal? Yes thats it thats it thats what they are
sending me there for thats what they want. Look at them running to and
fro about the streets every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at
heart and worse still an idiot. But try to get me off and theyd be
wild with righteous indignation. Oh how I hate them all!

He fell to musing by what process it could come to pass that he could
be humbled before all of them indiscriminately--humbled by conviction.
And yet why not? It must be so. Would not twenty years of continual
bondage crush him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why why should
he live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that it would be
so? It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that
question since the previous evening but still he went.



CHAPTER VIII

When he went into Sonias room it was already getting dark. All day
Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been
waiting with her. She had come to her that morning remembering
Svidrigalovs words that Sonia knew. We will not describe the
conversation and tears of the two girls and how friendly they became.
Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview that her
brother would not be alone. He had gone to her Sonia first with his
confession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it;
she would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask
but she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and
at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the point
of tears. She felt herself on the contrary hardly worthy to look at
Dounia. Dounias gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively
and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikovs room had
remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.

Dounia at last became impatient and leaving Sonia went to her
brothers room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come
there first. When she had gone Sonia began to be tortured by the dread
of his committing suicide and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent
the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be and both
were less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted each
thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how Svidrigalov had said to
her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or...
Besides she knew his vanity his pride and his lack of faith.

Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to
make him live? she thought at last in despair.

Meanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection looking
intently out of the window but from it she could see nothing but the
unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to
feel sure of his death--he walked into the room.

She gave a cry of joy but looking carefully into his face she turned
pale.

Yes said Raskolnikov smiling. I have come for your cross Sonia. It
was you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened
now its come to that?

Sonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold
shiver ran over her but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the
words were a mask. He spoke to her looking away as though to avoid
meeting her eyes.

You see Sonia Ive decided that it will be better so. There is one
fact.... But its a long story and theres no need to discuss it. But
do you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish
faces will be gaping at me directly pestering me with their stupid
questions which I shall have to answer--theyll point their fingers at
me.... Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry I am sick of him. Id
rather go to my friend the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise
him what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; Ive become
too irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my
sister just now because she turned to take a last look at me. Its
a brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well where are the
crosses?

He seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or
concentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after
one another he talked incoherently his hands trembled slightly.

Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses one of cypress
wood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and
over him and put the wooden cross on his neck.

Its the symbol of my taking up the cross he laughed. As though I
had not suffered much till now! The wooden cross that is the peasant
one; the copper one that is Lizavetas--you will wear yourself show
me! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things like
these too a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old
womans neck. Those would be appropriate now really those are what I
ought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what
matters; Im somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you
Sonia so that you might know... thats all--thats all I came for. But
I thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well now I
am going to prison and youll have your wish. Well what are you crying
for? You too? Dont. Leave off! Oh how I hate it all!

But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached as he looked at her. Why
is she grieving too? he thought to himself. What am I to her? Why does
she weep? Why is she looking after me like my mother or Dounia? Shell
be my nurse.

Cross yourself say at least one prayer Sonia begged in a timid
broken voice.

Oh certainly as much as you like! And sincerely Sonia sincerely....

But he wanted to say something quite different.

He crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and put
it over her head. It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which
Marmeladov had spoken the family shawl. Raskolnikov thought of that
looking at it but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he
was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He was
frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia
meant to go with him.

What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here stay! Ill go
alone he cried in cowardly vexation and almost resentful he moved
towards the door. Whats the use of going in procession? he muttered
going out.

Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said
good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt
surged in his heart.

Was it right was it right all this? he thought again as he went down
the stairs. Couldnt he stop and retract it all... and not go?

But still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustnt ask
himself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he
had not said good-bye to Sonia that he had left her in the middle of
the room in her green shawl not daring to stir after he had shouted
at her and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant another
thought dawned upon him as though it had been lying in wait to strike
him then.

Why with what object did I go to her just now? I told her--on
business; on what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her I was
_going_; but where was the need? Do I love her? No no I drove her away
just now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh how low Ive sunk! No
I wanted her tears I wanted to see her terror to see how her heart
ached! I had to have something to cling to something to delay me some
friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself to dream of what
I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch contemptible!

He walked along the canal bank and he had not much further to go. But
on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it
went to the Hay Market.

He looked eagerly to right and left gazed intently at every object and
could not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. In
another week another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this
bridge how shall I look at the canal then? I should like to remember
this! slipped into his mind. Look at this sign! How shall I read those
letters then? Its written here Campany thats a thing to remember
that letter _a_ and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look
at it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial
it all must be what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be
interesting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am
becoming a baby I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! how
people shove! that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed against
me does he know whom he pushed? Theres a peasant woman with a baby
begging. Its curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might
give her something for the incongruity of it. Heres a five copeck
piece left in my pocket where did I get it? Here here... take it my
good woman!

God bless you the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice.

He went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful very distasteful to be
in a crowd but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have
given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he
would not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and
disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There
was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd
stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short
jerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him
though he still stared. He moved away at last not remembering where he
was; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly
came over him overwhelming him body and mind.

He suddenly recalled Sonias words Go to the cross-roads bow down to
the people kiss the earth for you have sinned against it too and say
aloud to the whole world I am a murderer. He trembled remembering
that. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time especially
of the last hours had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively
clutched at the chance of this new unmixed complete sensation. It came
over him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and
spreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and the
tears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....

He knelt down in the middle of the square bowed down to the earth and
kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowed
down a second time.

Hes boozed a youth near him observed.

There was a roar of laughter.

Hes going to Jerusalem brothers and saying good-bye to his children
and his country. Hes bowing down to all the world and kissing the great
city of St. Petersburg and its pavement added a workman who was a
little drunk.

Quite a young man too! observed a third.

And a gentleman someone observed soberly.

Theres no knowing whos a gentleman and who isnt nowadays.

These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov and the words I am
a murderer which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips
died away. He bore these remarks quietly however and without looking
round he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a
glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt
that it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he
saw standing fifty paces from him on the left Sonia. She was hiding
from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She had
followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment felt
and knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow
him to the ends of the earth wherever fate might take him. It wrung his
heart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.

He went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third
storey. I shall be some time going up he thought. He felt as though
the fateful moment was still far off as though he had plenty of time
left for consideration.

Again the same rubbish the same eggshells lying about on the spiral
stairs again the open doors of the flats again the same kitchens and
the same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been
here since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him but
still they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath to
collect himself so as to enter _like a man_. But why? what for? he
wondered reflecting. If I must drink the cup what difference does it
make? The more revolting the better. He imagined for an instant the
figure of the explosive lieutenant Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually
going to him? Couldnt he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch?
Couldnt he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitchs lodgings?
At least then it would be done privately.... No no! To the explosive
lieutenant! If he must drink it drink it off at once.

Turning cold and hardly conscious he opened the door of the office.
There were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a
peasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.
Raskolnikov walked into the next room. Perhaps I still need not speak
 passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was
settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was
seating himself. Zametov was not there nor of course Nikodim Fomitch.

No one in? Raskolnikov asked addressing the person at the bureau.

Whom do you want?

A-ah! Not a sound was heard not a sight was seen but I scent the
Russian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... Ive forgotten! At
your service! a familiar voice cried suddenly.

Raskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him. He
had just come in from the third room. It is the hand of fate thought
Raskolnikov. Why is he here?

Youve come to see us? What about? cried Ilya Petrovitch. He
was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle
exhilarated. If its on business you are rather early.[*] Its only a
chance that I am here... however Ill do what I can. I must admit I...
what is it what is it? Excuse me....

     [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after
     sunset and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the
     police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for
     coming too late.--TRANSLATOR.

Raskolnikov.

Of course Raskolnikov. You didnt imagine Id forgotten? Dont think I
am like that... Rodion Ro--Ro--Rodionovitch thats it isnt it?

Rodion Romanovitch.

Yes yes of course Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. I
made many inquiries about you. I assure you Ive been genuinely grieved
since that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me
afterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and
so to say the first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientific
man does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have
the greatest respect for literature in my wife its a genuine passion!
Literature and art! If only a man is a gentleman all the rest can be
gained by talents learning good sense genius. As for a hat--well
what does a hat matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but
whats under the hat what the hat covers I cant buy that! I was even
meaning to come and apologise to you but thought maybe youd... But I
am forgetting to ask you is there anything you want really? I hear your
family have come?

Yes my mother and sister.

Ive even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister--a highly
cultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot with
you. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting
fit--that affair has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism!
I understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on
account of your familys arriving?

No I only looked in... I came to ask... I thought that I should find
Zametov here.

Oh yes! Of course youve made friends I heard. Well no Zametov is
not here. Yes weve lost Zametov. Hes not been here since yesterday...
he quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way. He is a
feather-headed youngster thats all; one might have expected something
from him but there you know what they are our brilliant young men.
He wanted to go in for some examination but its only to talk and
boast about it it will go no further than that. Of course its a very
different matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there your friend. Your
career is an intellectual one and you wont be deterred by failure. For
you one may say all the attractions of life _nihil est_--you are an
ascetic a monk a hermit!... A book a pen behind your ear a learned
research--thats where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself....
Have you read Livingstones Travels?

No.

Oh I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays you know
and indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? I
ask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me
openly openly!

N-no...

Believe me you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself!
Official duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say
_friendship_ is quite another? No youre wrong! Its not friendship
but the feeling of a man and a citizen the feeling of humanity and of
love for the Almighty. I may be an official but I am always bound
to feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were asking about Zametov.
Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad
reputation over a glass of champagne... thats all your Zametov is good
for! While Im perhaps so to speak burning with devotion and lofty
feelings and besides I have rank consequence a post! I am married and
have children I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen but who is
he may I ask? I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then
these midwives too have become extraordinarily numerous.

Raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words of Ilya
Petrovitch who had obviously been dining were for the most part a
stream of empty sounds for him. But some of them he understood. He
looked at him inquiringly not knowing how it would end.

I mean those crop-headed wenches the talkative Ilya Petrovitch
continued. Midwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactory
one ha-ha! They go to the Academy study anatomy. If I fall ill am
I to send for a young lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha! Ilya
Petrovitch laughed quite pleased with his own wit. Its an immoderate
zeal for education but once youre educated thats enough. Why abuse
it? Why insult honourable people as that scoundrel Zametov does? Why
did he insult me I ask you? Look at these suicides too how common
they are you cant fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill
themselves boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard
about a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch I say what
was the name of that gentleman who shot himself?

Svidrigalov someone answered from the other room with drowsy
listlessness.

Raskolnikov started.

Svidrigalov! Svidrigalov has shot himself! he cried.

What do you know Svidrigalov?

Yes... I knew him.... He hadnt been here long.

Yes thats so. He had lost his wife was a man of reckless habits and
all of a sudden shot himself and in such a shocking way.... He left
in his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of his
faculties and that no one is to blame for his death. He had money they
say. How did you come to know him?

I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his family.

Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him. You had
no suspicion?

I saw him yesterday... he... was drinking wine; I knew nothing.

Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling
him.

Youve turned pale again. Its so stuffy here...

Yes I must go muttered Raskolnikov. Excuse my troubling you....

Oh not at all as often as you like. Its a pleasure to see you and I
am glad to say so.

Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand.

I only wanted... I came to see Zametov.

I understand I understand and its a pleasure to see you.

I... am very glad... good-bye Raskolnikov smiled.

He went out; he reeled he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know
what he was doing. He began going down the stairs supporting himself
with his right hand against the wall. He fancied that a porter pushed
past him on his way upstairs to the police office that a dog in
the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a
rolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into the yard.
There not far from the entrance stood Sonia pale and horror-stricken.
She looked wildly at him. He stood still before her. There was a look of
poignant agony of despair in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips
worked in an ugly meaningless smile. He stood still a minute grinned
and went back to the police office.

Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers. Before
him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs.

Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind? Whats the matter?

Raskolnikov with white lips and staring eyes came slowly nearer.
He walked right to the table leaned his hand on it tried to say
something but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible.

You are feeling ill a chair! Here sit down! Some water!

Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair but he kept his eyes fixed on the
face of Ilya Petrovitch which expressed unpleasant surprise. Both
looked at one another for a minute and waited. Water was brought.

It was I... began Raskolnikov.

Drink some water.

Raskolnikov refused the water with his hand and softly and brokenly
but distinctly said:

_It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with
an axe and robbed them._

Ilya Petrovitch opened his mouth. People ran up on all sides.

Raskolnikov repeated his statement.



EPILOGUE

I

Siberia. On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town one of
the administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress
in the fortress there is a prison. In the prison the second-class
convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months. Almost a
year and a half has passed since his crime.

There had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered
exactly firmly and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor
misrepresent the facts nor soften them in his own interest nor omit
the smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder the
secret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which
was found in the murdered womans hand. He described minutely how he
had taken her keys what they were like as well as the chest and its
contents; he explained the mystery of Lizavetas murder; described how
Koch and after him the student knocked and repeated all they had said
to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay
and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards
gone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the
Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.
The whole thing in fact was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the
judges were very much struck among other things by the fact that he
had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone without making
use of them and that what was more he did not now remember what the
trinkets were like or even how many there were. The fact that he had
never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed
incredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and
seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone
some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the
damp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man
should tell a lie about this when about everything else he had made
a truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers
more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really
not looked into the purse and so didnt know what was in it when he
hid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that
the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental
derangement through homicidal mania without object or the pursuit of
gain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary
insanity so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover
Raskolnikovs hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses by
Dr. Zossimov his former fellow students his landlady and her servant.
All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not
quite like an ordinary murderer and robber but that there was another
element in the case.

To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion the
criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question
as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery he
answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was
his miserable position his poverty and helplessness and his desire to
provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand
roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder
through his shallow and cowardly nature exasperated moreover by
privation and failure. To the question what led him to confess he
answered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost
coarse....

The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected
perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself
but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange
and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.
There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition
of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he
had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse partly to his
abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the
murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man
commits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally the
confession at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by
the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism
and when moreover there were no proofs against the real criminal no
suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did
much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances too in the prisoners
favour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and
proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor
consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting
him for six months and when this student died leaving a decrepit
old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year
Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral
when he died. Raskolnikovs landlady bore witness too that when they
had lived in another house at Five Corners Raskolnikov had rescued two
little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was
investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts
made an impression in his favour.

And in the end the criminal was in consideration of extenuating
circumstances condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a
term of eight years only.

At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikovs mother fell ill. Dounia
and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the
trial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg so
as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time
to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovnas
illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial
derangement of her intellect.

When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother she
had found her mother already ill in feverish delirium. That evening
Razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mothers
questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her
mothers benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia
on a business commission which would bring him in the end money and
reputation.

But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never
asked them anything on the subject neither then nor thereafter. On the
contrary she had her own version of her sons sudden departure; she
told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her hinting
that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts and that Rodya
had many very powerful enemies so that it was necessary for him to be
in hiding. As for his future career she had no doubt that it would be
brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assured
Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman that his
article and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was
continually reading she even read it aloud almost took it to bed
with her but scarcely asked where Rodya was though the subject was
obviously avoided by the others which might have been enough to awaken
her suspicions.

They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovnas strange
silence on certain subjects. She did not for instance complain of
getting no letters from him though in previous years she had only lived
on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of
great uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother
suspected that there was something terrible in her sons fate and was
afraid to ask for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any
case Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of
her faculties.

It happened once or twice however that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave
such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her
without mentioning where Rodya was and on receiving unsatisfactory and
suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent and this mood
lasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive
her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely
silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that
the poor mother suspected something terrible. Dounia remembered her
brothers telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her
sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigalov and before the
fatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?
Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be
succeeded by a period of hysterical animation and the invalid would
begin to talk almost incessantly of her son of her hopes of his
future.... Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured her
pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending)
but she still went on talking.

Five months after Raskolnikovs confession he was sentenced. Razumihin
and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. At last
the moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that the
separation should not be for ever Razumihin did the same. Razumihin in
his youthful ardour had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least
of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years and saving
up a certain sum to emigrate to Siberia a country rich in every
natural resource and in need of workers active men and capital. There
they would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would
begin a new life. They all wept at parting.

Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He asked a great
deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her. He worried
so much about her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his
mothers illness he became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly
reserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her by
Svidrigalov Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the
party of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia. Not a word
passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject but both knew it
would be so. At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his
sisters and Razumihins fervent anticipations of their happy future
together when he should come out of prison. He predicted that their
mothers illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at last
set off.

Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It was a quiet and
sorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however.
During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.
Dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she
could not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength of will.
Among other things he began attending university lectures again in order
to take his degree. They were continually making plans for the future;
both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least. Till
then they rested their hopes on Sonia.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounias
marriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more
melancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how
Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father
and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two
little children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria
Alexandrovnas disordered imagination almost to ecstasy. She was
continually talking about them even entering into conversation with
strangers in the street though Dounia always accompanied her. In public
conveyances and shops wherever she could capture a listener she would
begin the discourse about her son his article how he had helped the
student how he had been burnt at the fire and so on! Dounia did
not know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of her morbid
excitement there was the risk of someones recalling Raskolnikovs name
and speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the
address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted
on going to see her.

At last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimes
begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. One
morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home
that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must
expect him back in nine months. She began to prepare for his coming
began to do up her room for him to clean the furniture to wash and
put up new hangings and so on. Dounia was anxious but said nothing and
helped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual
fancies in joyful day-dreams and tears Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.
It was brain fever. She died within a fortnight. In her delirium she
dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her
sons terrible fate than they had supposed.

For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mothers death though
a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached
Siberia. It was carried on by means of Sonia who wrote every month
to the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. At
first they found Sonias letters dry and unsatisfactory but later on
they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better for
from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate
brothers life. Sonias letters were full of the most matter-of-fact
detail the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikovs
surroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes no
conjecture as to the future no description of her feelings. Instead of
any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life she gave the
simple facts--that is his own words an exact account of his health
what he asked for at their interviews what commission he gave her
and so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness. The
picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness
and precision. There could be no mistake because nothing was given but
facts.

But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news
especially at first. Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not
ready to talk that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave
him from their letters that he sometimes asked after his mother and
that when seeing that he had guessed the truth she told him at last
of her death she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly
affected by it not externally at any rate. She told them that although
he seemed so wrapped up in himself and as it were shut himself off
from everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;
that he understood his position expected nothing better for the time
had no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely
seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings so unlike anything he
had known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his
work without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent
about food but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that
at last he had been glad to accept some money from her Sonia to have
his own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else
declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote
further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest that she
had not seen the inside of their barracks but concluded that they were
crowded miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a
rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that
he lived so poorly and roughly not from any plan or design but simply
from inattention and indifference.

Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits
had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming unwilling to talk and
rude to her. But that in the end these visits had become a habit and
almost a necessity for him so that he was positively distressed when
she was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see him
on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room to which he was
brought for a few minutes to see her. On working days she would go to
see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns or at the
sheds on the banks of the Irtish.

About herself Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some
acquaintances in the town that she did sewing and as there
was scarcely a dressmaker in the town she was looked upon as an
indispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that the
authorities were through her interested in Raskolnikov; that his task
was lightened and so on.

At last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and
uneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone
that his fellow prisoners did not like him that he kept silent for days
at a time and was becoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wrote
that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of
the hospital.



II

He was ill a long time. But it was not the horrors of prison life not
the hard labour the bad food the shaven head or the patched clothes
that crushed him. What did he care for all those trials and hardships!
he was even glad of the hard work. Physically exhausted he could at
least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to
him--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In the past as a
student he had often not had even that. His clothes were warm and suited
to his manner of life. He did not even feel the fetters. Was he ashamed
of his shaven head and parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia?
Sonia was afraid of him how could he be ashamed before her? And yet he
was ashamed even before Sonia whom he tortured because of it with
his contemptuous rough manner. But it was not his shaven head and his
fetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick. It was
wounded pride that made him ill. Oh how happy he would have been if he
could have blamed himself! He could have borne anything then even
shame and disgrace. But he judged himself severely and his exasperated
conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past except
a simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed just
because he Raskolnikov had so hopelessly stupidly come to grief
through some decree of blind fate and must humble himself and submit to
the idiocy of a sentence if he were anyhow to be at peace.

Vague and objectless anxiety in the present and in the future a
continual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before
him. And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he
would only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life! What had he to
live for? What had he to look forward to? Why should he strive? To live
in order to exist? Why he had been ready a thousand times before to
give up existence for the sake of an idea for a hope even for a fancy.
Mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted
more. Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he
had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others.

And if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that
would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep that repentance the
awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning! Oh he would
have been glad of it! Tears and agonies would at least have been life.
But he did not repent of his crime.

At least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity as he
had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison.
But now in prison _in freedom_ he thought over and criticised all his
actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque
as they had seemed at the fatal time.

In what way he asked himself was my theory stupider than others
that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world? One has
only to look at the thing quite independently broadly and uninfluenced
by commonplace ideas and my idea will by no means seem so... strange.
Oh sceptics and halfpenny philosophers why do you halt half-way!

Why does my action strike them as so horrible? he said to himself. Is
it because it was a crime? What is meant by crime? My conscience is at
rest. Of course it was a legal crime of course the letter of the law
was broken and blood was shed. Well punish me for the letter of the
law... and thats enough. Of course in that case many of the
benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of
inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps. But
those men succeeded and so _they were right_ and I didnt and so I
had no right to have taken that step.

It was only in that that he recognised his criminality only in the fact
that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it.

He suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself? Why
had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess? Was the
desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it? Had not
Svidrigalov overcome it although he was afraid of death?

In misery he asked himself this question and could not understand that
at the very time he had been standing looking into the river he had
perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and
his convictions. He didnt understand that that consciousness might be
the promise of a future crisis of a new view of life and of his future
resurrection.

He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he
could not step over again through weakness and meanness. He looked at
his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and
prized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in
prison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of
them the tramps for instance had endured! Could they care so much for
a ray of sunshine for the primeval forest the cold spring hidden away
in some unseen spot which the tramp had marked three years before and
longed to see again as he might to see his sweetheart dreaming of the
green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on he
saw still more inexplicable examples.

In prison of course there was a great deal he did not see and did not
want to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. It was loathsome
and unbearable for him to look. But in the end there was much that
surprised him and he began as it were involuntarily to notice much
that he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was
the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. They
seemed to be a different species and he looked at them and they at
him with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of his
isolation but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons
were so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles political
prisoners among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as
ignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.
He saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the
Poles. There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous a former
officer and two seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.
He was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at
last--why he could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despised
and laughed at his crime.

Youre a gentleman they used to say. You shouldnt hack about with
an axe; thats not a gentlemans work.

The second week in Lent his turn came to take the sacrament with his
gang. He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out
one day he did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury.

Youre an infidel! You dont believe in God they shouted. You ought
to be killed.

He had never talked to them about God nor his belief but they wanted to
kill him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at
him in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;
his eyebrows did not quiver his face did not flinch. The guard
succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant or there would
have been bloodshed.

There was another question he could not decide: why were they all so
fond of Sonia? She did not try to win their favour; she rarely met
them sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment. And yet
everybody knew her they knew that she had come out to follow _him_
knew how and where she lived. She never gave them money did them no
particular services. Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents
of pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations sprang up between
them and Sonia. She would write and post letters for them to their
relations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town at their
instructions left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives
and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when she visited
Raskolnikov at work or met a party of the prisoners on the road they
all took off their hats to her. Little mother Sofya Semyonovna you
are our dear good little mother coarse branded criminals said to that
frail little creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone was
delighted when she smiled. They even admired her gait and turned round
to watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little and in
fact did not know what to admire her most for. They even came to her
for help in their illnesses.

He was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. When
he was better he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish
and delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a
terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of
Asia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts
of microbes were attacking the bodies of men but these microbes were
endowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once
mad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual
and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers never
had they considered their decisions their scientific conclusions their
moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages whole towns and peoples
went mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand
one another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched
looking at the others beat himself on the breast wept and wrung
his hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to
consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame whom
to justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They
gathered together in armies against one another but even on the march
the armies would begin attacking each other the ranks would be broken
and the soldiers would fall on each other stabbing and cutting biting
and devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in
the towns; men rushed together but why they were summoned and who was
summoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned
because everyone proposed his own ideas his own improvements and they
could not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups agreed
on something swore to keep together but at once began on something
quite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another
fought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All
men and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and
moved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole
world. They were a pure chosen people destined to found a new race and
a new life to renew and purify the earth but no one had seen these
men no one had heard their words and their voices.

Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so
miserably the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.
The second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring
days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel
paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during
his illness; each time she had to obtain permission and it was
difficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard especially
in the evening sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the
windows of the ward.

One evening when he was almost well again Raskolnikov fell asleep. On
waking up he chanced to go to the window and at once saw Sonia in the
distance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.
Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and
moved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come nor the day
after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was
discharged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that
Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.

He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that
her illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her
Sonia sent him a pencilled note telling him that she was much better
that she had a slight cold and that she would soon very soon come and
see him at his work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.

Again it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning at six oclock he
went off to work on the river bank where they used to pound alabaster
and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only
three of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the
fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and
laying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river
bank sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the
wide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before
him the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.
In the vast steppe bathed in sunshine he could just see like black
specks the nomads tents. There there was freedom there other men were
living utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand
still as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.
Raskolnikov sat gazing his thoughts passed into day-dreams into
contemplation; he thought of nothing but a vague restlessness excited
and troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up
noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the
morning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the
green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness it was thinner and
paler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome but held out her hand
with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand
to him and sometimes did not offer it at all as though afraid he would
repel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance always
seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout
her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply
grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance
at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were
alone no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.

How it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to
seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round
her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she
turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same
moment she understood and a light of infinite happiness came into her
eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and
that at last the moment had come....

They wanted to speak but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They
were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the
dawn of a new future of a full resurrection into a new life. They were
renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the
heart of the other.

They resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to
wait and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before
them! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his
being while she--she only lived in his life.

On the evening of the same day when the barracks were locked
Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied
that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him
differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered
him in a friendly way. He remembered that now and thought it was bound
to be so. Wasnt everything now bound to be changed?

He thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her
and wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face.
But these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what
infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all
_all_ the agonies of the past! Everything even his crime his sentence
and imprisonment seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an
external strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not
think for long together of anything that evening and he could not have
analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped
into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself
out in his mind.

Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.
The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the
raising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry
him about religion would talk about the gospel and pester him with
books. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject
and had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for it
himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without
a word. Till now he had not opened it.

He did not open it now but one thought passed through his mind: Can
her convictions not be mine now? Her feelings her aspirations at
least....

She too had been greatly agitated that day and at night she was taken
ill again. But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was
almost frightened of her happiness. Seven years _only_ seven years! At
the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready
to look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did not
know that the new life would not be given him for nothing that he would
have to pay dearly for it that it would cost him great striving great
suffering.

But that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual
renewal of a man the story of his gradual regeneration of his passing
from one world into another of his initiation into a new unknown life.
That might be the subject of a new story but our present story is
ended.

POLTARNEES BEHOLDER OF OCEAN


Toldees Mondath Arizim these are the Inner Lands the lands whose
sentinels upon their borders do not behold the sea. Beyond them to the
east there lies a desert for ever untroubled by man: all yellow it is
and spotted with shadows of stones and Death is in it like a leopard
lying in the sun. To the south they are bounded by magic to the west by a
mountain and to the north by the voice and anger of the Polar wind. Like
a great wall is the mountain to the west. It comes up out of the distance
and goes down into the distance again and it is named Poltarnees
Beholder of Ocean. To the northward red rocks smooth and bare of soil
and without any speck of moss or herbage slope up to the very lips of the
Polar wind and there is nothing else there by the noise of his anger.
Very peaceful are the Inner Lands and very fair are their cities and
there is no war among them but quiet and ease. And they have no enemy but
age for thirst and fever lie sunning themselves out in the mid-desert
and never prowl into the Inner Lands. And the ghouls and ghosts whose
highway is the night are kept in the south by the boundary of magic. And
very small are all their pleasant cities and all men are known to one
another therein and bless one another by name as they meet in the
streets. And they have a broad green way in every city that comes in out
of some vale or wood or downland and wanders in and out about the city
between the houses and across the streets and the people walk along it
never at all but every year at her appointed time Spring walks along it
from the flowery lands causing the anemone to bloom on the green way and
all the early joys of hidden woods or deep secluded vales or triumphant
downlands whose heads lift up so proudly far up aloof from cities.

Sometimes waggoners or shepherds walk along this way they that have come
into the city from over cloudy ridges and the townsmen hinder them not
for there is a tread that troubleth the grass and a tread that troubleth
it not and each man in his own heart knoweth which tread he hath. And in
the sunlit spaces of the weald and in the wold's dark places afar from
the music of cities and from the dance of the cities afar they make there
the music of the country places and dance the country dance. Amiable near
and friendly appears to these men the sun and as he is genial to them and
tends their younger vines so they are kind to the little woodland things
and any rumour of the fairies or old legend. And when the light of some
little distant city makes a slight flush upon the edge of the sky and the
happy golden windows of the homesteads stare gleaming into the dark then
the old and holy figure of Romance cloaked even to the face comes down
out of hilly woodlands and bids dark shadows to rise and dance and sends
the forest creatures forth to prowl and lights in a moment in her bower
of grass the little glowworm's lamp and brings a hush down over the grey
lands and out of it rises faintly on far-off hills the voice of a lute.
There are not in the world lands more prosperous and happy than Toldees
Mondath Arizim.

From these three little kingdoms that are named the Inner Lands the young
men stole constantly away. One by one they went and no one knew why they
went save that they had a longing to behold the Sea. Of this longing they
spoke little but a young man would become silent for a few days and
then one morning very early he would slip away and slowly climb
Poltarnee's difficult slope and having attained the top pass over and
never return. A few stayed behind in the Inner Lands and became the old
men but none that had ever climbed Poltarnees from the very earliest
times had ever come back again. Many had gone up Poltarnees sworn to
return. Once a king sent all his courtiers one by one to report the
mystery to him and then went himself; none ever returned.

Now it was the wont of the folk of the Inner Lands to worship rumours and
legends of the Sea and all that their prophets discovered of the Sea was
writ in a sacred book and with deep devotion on days of festival or
mourning read in the temples by the priests. Now all their temples lay
open to the west resting upon pillars that the breeze from the Sea might
enter them and they lay open on pillars to the east that the breezes of
the Sea might not be hindered by pass onward wherever the Sea list. And
this is the legend that they had of the Sea whom none in the Inner Lands
had ever beholden. They say that the Sea is a river heading towards
Hercules and they say that he touches against the edge of the world and
that Poltarnees looks upon him. They say that all the worlds of heaven go
bobbing on this river and are swept down with the stream and that
Infinity is thick and furry with forests through which the river in his
course sweeps on with all the worlds of heaven. Among the colossal trunks
of those dark trees the smallest fronds of whose branches are man nights
there walk the gods. And whenever its thirst glowing in space like a
great sun comes upon the beast the tiger of the gods creeps down to the
river to drink. And the tiger of the gods drinks his fill loudly whelming
worlds the while and the level of the river sinks between its banks ere
the beast's thirst is quenched and ceases to glow like a sun. And many
worlds thereby are heaped up dry and stranded and the gods walk not among
them evermore because they are hard to their feet. These are the worlds
that have no destiny whose people know no god. And the river sweeps
onwards ever. And the name of the River is Oriathon but men call it
Ocean. This is the Lower Faith of the Inner Lands. And there is a Higher
Faith which is not told to all. Oriathon sweeps on through the forests of
Infinity and all at once falls roaring over an Edge whence Time has long
ago recalled his hours to fight in his war with the gods; and falls unlit
by the flash of nights and days with his flood unmeasured by miles into
the deeps of nothing.

Now as the centuries went by and the one way by which a man could climb
Poltarnees became worn with feet more and more men surmounted it not to
return. And still they knew not in the Inner Lands upon what mystery
Poltarnees looked. For on a still day and windless while men walked
happily about their beautiful streets or tended flocks in the country
suddenly the west wind would bestir himself and come in from the Sea. And
he would come cloaked and grey and mournful and carry to someone the
hungry cry of the Sea calling out for bones of men. And he that heard it
would move restlessly for some hours and at last would rise suddenly
irresistibly up setting his face to Poltarnees and would say as is the
custom of those lands when men part briefly Till a man's heart
remembereth which means Farewell for a while; but those that loved
him seeing his eyes on Poltarnees would answer sadly Till the gods
forget which means Farewell.

Now the king of Arizim had a daughter who played with the wild wood
flowers and with the fountains in her father's court and with the little
blue heaven-birds that came to her doorway in the winter to shelter from
the snow. And she was more beautiful than the wild wood flowers or than
all the fountains in her father's court or than the blue heaven-birds in
their full winter plumage when they shelter from the snow. The old wise
kings of Mondath and of Toldees saw her once as she went lightly down the
little paths of her garden and turning their gaze into the mists of
thought pondered the destiny of their Inner Lands. And they watched her
closely by the stately flowers and standing alone in the sunlight and
passing and repassing the strutting purple birds that the king's fowlers
had brought from Asaghon. When she was of the age of fifteen years the
King of Mondath called a council of kings. And there met with him the
kings of Toldees and Arizim. And the King of Mondath in his Council said:

The call of the unappeased and hungry Sea (and at the word 'Sea' the
three kings bowed their heads) lures every year out of our happy kingdoms
more and more of our men and still we know not the mystery of the Sea
and no devised oath has brought one man back. Now thy daughter Arizim is
lovelier than the sunlight and lovelier than those stately flowers of
thine that stand so tall in her garden and hath more grace and beauty
than those strange birds that the venturous fowlers bring in creaking
wagons out of Asaghon whose feathers are alternate purple and white.
Now he that shall love thy daughter Hilnaric whoever he shall be is
the man to climb Poltarnees and return as none hath ever before and tell
us upon what Poltarnees looks; for it may be that they daughter is more
beautiful than the Sea.

Then from his Seat of Council arose the King of Arizim. He said: I fear
that thou hast spoken blasphemy against the Sea and I have a dread that
ill will come of it. Indeed I had not thought she was so fair. It is such
a short while ago that she was quite a small child with her hair still
unkempt and not yet attired in the manner of princesses and she would go
up into the wild woods unattended and come back with her robes unseemly
and all torn and would not take reproof with a humble spirit but made
grimaces even in my marble court all set about with fountains.

Then said the King of Toldees:

Let us watch more closely and let us see the Princess Hilnaric in the
season of the orchard-bloom when the great birds go by that know the Sea
to rest in our inland places; and if she be more beautiful than the
sunrise over our folded kingdoms when all the orchards bloom it may be
that she is more beautiful than the Sea.

And the King of Arizim said:

I fear this is terrible blasphemy yet will I do as you have decided in
council.

And the season of the orchard-bloom appeared. One night the King of Arizim
called his daughter forth on his outer balcony of marble. And the moon was
rising huge and round and holy over dark woods and all the fountains were
singing to the night. And the moon touched the marble palace gables and
they glowed in the land. And the moon touched the heads of all the
fountains and the grey columns broke into fairy lights. And the moon left
the dark ways of the forest and lit the whole white palace and its
fountains and shone on the forehead of the Princess and the palace of
Arizim glowed afar and the fountains became columns of gleaming jewels
and song. And the moon made a music at its rising but it fell a little
short of mortal ears. And Hilnaric stood there wondering clad in white
with the moonlight shining on her forehead; and watching her from the
shadows on the terrace stood the kings of Mondath and Toldees. They said.

She is more beautiful than the moonrise. And the season of the
orchard-bloom appeared. One night the King of Arizim called his daughter
forth on his outer balcony of marble. And the moon was rising huge and
round and holy over dark woods and all the fountains were singing to the
night. And the moon touched the marble palace gables and they glowed in
the land. And the moon touched the heads of all the fountains and the
grey columns broke into fairy lights. And the moon left the dark ways of
the forest and lit the whole white palace and its fountains and shone on
the forehead of the Princess and the palace of Arizim glowed afar and
the fountains became columns of gleaming jewels and song. And the moon
made a music at its rising but it fell a little short of mortal ears. And
Hilnaric stood there wondering clad in white with the moonlight shining
on her forehead; and watching her from the shadows on the terrace stood
the kings of Mondath and Toldees. They said:

She is more beautiful than the moonrise. And on another day the King of
Arizim bade his daughter forth at dawn and they stood again upon the
balcony. And the sun came up over a world of orchards and the sea-mists
went back over Poltarnees to the Sea; little wild voices arose in all the
thickets the voices of the fountains began to die and the song arose in
all the marble temples of the birds that are sacred to the Sea. And
Hilnaric stood there still glowing with dreams of heaven.

She is more beautiful said the kings than morning.

Yet one more trial they made of Hilnaric's beauty for they watched her on
the terraces at sunset ere yet the petals of the orchards had fallen and
all along the edge of neighbouring woods the rhododendron was blooming
with the azalea. And the sun went down under craggy Poltarnees and the
sea-mist poured over his summit inland. And the marble temples stood up
clear in the evening but films of twilight were drawn between the
mountain and the city. Then from the Temple ledges and eaves of palaces
the bats fell headlong downwards then spread their wings and floated up
and down through darkening ways; lights came blinking out in golden
windows men cloaked themselves against the grey sea-mist the sound of
small songs arose and the face of Hilnaric became a resting-place for
mysteries and dreams.

Than all these things said the kings she is more lovely: but who can
say whether she is lovelier than the Sea?

Prone in a rhododendron thicket at the edge of the palace lawns a hunter
had waited since the sun went down. Near to him was a deep pool where the
hyacinths grew and strange flowers floated upon it with broad leaves; and
there the great bull gariachs came down to drink by starlight; and
waiting there for the gariachs to come he saw the white form of the
Princess leaning on her balcony. Before the stars shone out or the bulls
came down to drink he left his lurking-place and moved closer to the
palace to see more nearly the Princess. The palace lawns were full of
untrodden dew and everything was still when he came across them holding
his great spear. In the farthest corner of the terraces the three old
kings were discussing the beauty of Hilnaric and the destiny of the Inner
Lands. Moving lightly with a hunter's tread the watcher by the pool came
very near even in the still evening before the Princess saw him. When he
saw her closely he exclaimed suddenly:

She must be more beautiful than the Sea.

When the Princess turned and saw his garb and his great spear she knew
that he was a hunter of gariachs.

When the three kings heard the young man exclaim they said softly to one
another:

This must be the man.

Then they revealed themselves to him and spoke to him to try him. They
said:

Sir you have spoken blasphemy against the Sea.

And the young man muttered:

She is more beautiful than the Sea.

And the kings said:

We are older than you and wiser and know that nothing is more beautiful
than the Sea.

And the young man took off the gear of his head and became downcast and
he knew that he spake with kings yet he answered:

By this spear she is more beautiful than the Sea.

And all the while the Princess stared at him knowing him to be a hunter
of gariachs.

Then the king of Arizim said to the watcher by the pool:

If thou wilt go up Poltarnees and come back as none have come and
report to us what lure or magic is in the Sea we will pardon thy
blasphemy and thou shalt have the Princess to wife and sit among the
Council of Kings.

And gladly thereunto the young man consented. And the Princess spoke to
him and asked him his name. And he told her that his name was Athelvok
and great joy arose in him at the sound of her voice. And to the three
kings he promised to set out on the third day to scale the slope of
Poltarnees and to return again and this was the oath by which they bound
him to return:

I swear by the Sea that bears the worlds away by the river of Oriathon
which men call Ocean and by the gods and their tiger and by the doom of
the worlds that I will return again to the Inner Lands having beheld the
Sea.

And that oath he swore with solemnity that very night in one of the
temples of the Sea but the three kings trusted more to the beauty of
Hilnaric even than to the power of the oath.

The next day Athelvok came to the palace of Arizim with the morning over
the fields to the East and out of the country of Toldees and Hilnaric
came out along her balcony and met him on the terraces. And she asked him
if he had ever slain a gariach and he said that he had slain three and
then he told her how he had killed his first down by the pool in the wood.
For he had taken his father's spear and gone down to the edge of the pool
and had lain under the azaleas there waiting for the stars to shine by
whose first light the gariachs go to the pools to drink; and he had gone
too early and had had long to wait and the passing hours seemed longer
than they were. And all the birds came in that home at night and the bat
was abroad and the hour of the duck went by and still no gariach came
down to the pool; and Athelvok felt sure that none would come. And just as
this grew to a certainty in his mind the thicket parted noiselessly and a
huge bull gariach stood facing him on the edge of the water and his great
horns swept out sideways from his head and at the ends curved upwards
and were four strides in width from tip to tip. And he had not seen
Athelvok for the great bull was on the far side of the little pool and
Athelvok could not creep round to him for fear of meeting the wind (for
the gariachs who can see little in the dark forests rely on hearing and
smell). But he devised swiftly in his mind while the bull stood there with
head erect just twenty strides from him across the water. And the bull
sniffed the wind cautiously and listened then lowered his great head down
to the pool and drank. At that instant Athelvok leapt into the water and
shot forward through its weedy depths among the stems of the strange
flowers that floated upon broad leaves on the surface. And Athelvok kept
his spear out straight before him and the fingers of his left hand he
held rigid and straight not pointing upwards and so did not come to the
surface but was carried onward by the strength of his spring and passed
unentangled through the stems of the flowers. When Athelvok jumped into
the water the bull must have thrown his head up startled at the splash
then he would have listened and have sniffed the air and neither hearing
nor scenting any danger he must have remained rigid for some moments for
it was in that attitude that Athelvok found him as he emerged breathless
at his feet. And striking at once Athelvok drove the spear into his
throat before the head and the terrible horns came down. But Athelvok had
clung to one of the great horns and had been carried at terrible speed
through the rhododendron bushes until the gariach fell but rose at once
again and died standing up still struggling drowned in its own blood.

But to Hilnaric listening it was as though one of the heroes of old time
had come back again in the full glory of his legendary youth.

And long time they went up and down the terraces saying those things
which were said before and since and which lips shall yet be made to say
again. And above them stood Poltarnees beholding the Sea.

And the day came when Athelvok should go. And Hilnaric said to him:

Will you not indeed most surely come back again having just looked over
the summit of Poltarnees?

Athelvok answered: I will indeed come back for thy voice is more
beautiful than the hymn of the priests when they chant and praise the Sea
and though many tributary seas ran down into Oriathon and he and all the
others poured their beauty into one pool below me yet would I return
swearing that thou were fairer than they.

And Hilnaric answered:

The wisdom of my heart tells me or old knowledge or prophecy or some
strange lore that I shall never hear thy voice again. And for this I give
thee my forgiveness.

But he repeating the oath that he had sworn set out looking often
backwards until the slope became to step and his face was set to the rock.
It was in the morning that he started and he climbed all the day with
little rest where every foot-hole was smooth with many feet. Before he
reached the top the sun disappeared from him and darker and darker grew
the Inner Lands. Then he pushed on so as to see before dark whatever thing
Poltarnees had to show. The dusk was deep over the Inner Lands and the
lights of cities twinkled through the sea-mist when he came to
Poltarnees's summit and the sun before him was not yet gone from the sky.

And there below him was the old wrinkled Sea smiling and murmuring song.
And he nursed little ships with gleaming sails and in his hands were old
regretted wrecks and mast all studded over with golden nails that he had
rent in anger out of beautiful galleons. And the glory of the sun was
among the surges as they brought driftwood out of isles of spice tossing
their golden heads. And the grey currents crept away to the south like
companionless serpents that love something afar with a restless deadly
love. And the whole plain of water glittering with late sunlight and the
surges and the currents and the white sails of ships were all together
like the face of a strange new god that has looked at a man for the first
time in the eyes at the moment of his death; and Athelvok looking on the
wonderful Sea knew why it was that the dead never return for there is
something that the dead feel and know and the living would never
understand even though the dead should come and speak to them about it.
And there was the Sea smiling at him glad with the glory of the sun. And
there was a haven there for homing ships and a sunlit city stood upon its
marge and people walked about the streets of it clad in the unimagined
merchandise of far sea-bordering lands.

An easy slope of loose rock went from the top of Poltarnees to the shore
of the Sea.

For a long while Athelvok stood there regretfully knowing that there had
come something into his soul that no one in the Inner Lands could
understand where the thoughts of their minds had gone no farther than the
three little kingdoms. Then looking long upon the wandering ships and
the marvelous merchandise from alien lands and the unknown colour that
wreathed the brows of the Sea he turned his face to the darkness and the
Inner Lands.

At that moment the Sea sang a dirge at sunset for all the harm that he had
done in anger and all the ruin wrought on adventurous ships; and there
were tears in the voice of the tyrannous Sea for he had loved the
galleons that he had overwhelmed and he called all men to him and all
living things that he might make amends because he had loved the bones
that he had strewn afar. And Athelvok turned and set one foot upon the
crumbled slope and then another and walked a little way to be nearer to
the Sea and then a dream came upon him and he felt that men had wronged
the lovely Sea because he had been angry a little because he had been
sometimes cruel; he felt that there was trouble among the tides of the Sea
because he had loved the galleons who were dead. Still he walked on and
the crumbled stones rolled with him and just as the twilight faded and a
star appeared he came to the golden shore and walked on till the surges
were about his knees and he heard the prayer-like blessings of the Sea.
Long he stood thus while the stars came out above him and shone again in
the surges; more stars came wheeling in their courses up from the Sea
lights twinkled out through all the haven city lanterns were slung from
the ships the purple night burned on; and Earth to the eyes of the gods
as they sat afar glowed as with one flame. Then Athelvok went into the
haven city; there he met many who had left the Inner Lands before him;
none of them wished to return to the people who had not seen the Sea; many
of them had forgotten the three little kingdoms and it was rumoured that
one man who had once tried to return had found the shifting crumbled
slope impossible to climb.

Hilnaric never married. But her dowry was set aside to build a temple
wherein men curse the ocean.

Once every year with solemn rite and ceremony they curse the tides of
the Sea; and the moon looks in and hates them.




BLAGDAROSS


On a waste place strewn with bricks in the outskirts of a town twilight
was falling. A star or two appeared over the smoke and distant windows
lit mysterious lights. The stillness deepened and the loneliness. Then all
the outcast things that are silent by day found voices.

An old cork spoke first. He said: I grew in Andalusian woods but never
listened to the idle songs of Spain. I only grew strong in the sunlight
waiting for my destiny. One day the merchants came and took us all away
and carried us all along the shore of the sea piled high on the backs of
donkeys and in a town by the sea they made me into the shape that I am
now. One day they sent me northward to Provence and there I fulfilled my
destiny. For they set me as a guard over the bubbling wine and I
faithfully stood sentinel for twenty years. For the first few years in the
bottle that I guarded the wine slept dreaming of Provence; but as the
years went on he grew stronger and stronger until at last whenever a man
went by the wind would put out all his might against me saying 'Let me
go free; let me go free!' And every year his strength increased and he
grew more clamourous when men went by but never availed to hurl me from
my post. But when I had powerfully held him for twenty years they brought
him to the banquet and took me from my post and the wine arose rejoicing
and leapt through the veins of men and exalted their souls within them
till they stood up in their places and sang Provenal songs. But me they
cast away--me that had been sentinel for twenty years and was still as
strong and staunch as when first I went on guard. Now I am an outcast in a
cold northern city who once have known the Andalusian skies and guarded
long ago Provenal suns that swam in the heart of the rejoicing wine.

An unstruck match that somebody had dropped spoke next. I am a child of
the sun he said and an enemy of cities; there is more in my heart than
you know of. I am a brother of Etna and Stromboli; I have fires lurking in
me that will one day rise up beautiful and strong. We will not go into
servitude on any hearth nor work machines for our food but we will take
out own food where we find it on that day when we are strong. There are
wonderful children in my heart whose faces shall be more lively than the
rainbow; they shall make a compact with the North wind and he shall lead
them forth; all shall be black behind them and black above them and there
shall be nothing beautiful in the world but them; they shall seize upon
the earth and it shall be theirs and nothing shall stop them but our old
enemy the sea.

Then an old broken kettle spoke and said: I am the friend of cities. I
sit among the slaves upon the hearth the little flames that have been fed
with coal. When the slaves dance behind the iron bars I sit in the middle
of the dance and sing and make our masters glad. And I make songs about
the comfort of the cat and about the malice that is towards her in the
heart of the dog and about the crawling of the baby and about the ease
that is in the lord of the house when we brew the good brown tea; and
sometimes when the house is very warm and slaves and masters are glad I
rebuke the hostile winds that prowl about the world.

And then there spoke the piece of an old cord. I was made in a place of
doom and doomed men made my fibres working without hope. Therefore there
came a grimness into my heart so that I never let anything go free when
once I was set to bind it. Many a thing have I bound relentlessly for
months and years; for I used to come coiling into warehouses where the
great boxes lay all open to the air and one of them would be suddenly
closed up and my fearful strength would be set on him like accurse and
if his timbers groaned when first I seized them or if they creaked aloud
in the lonely night thinking of woodlands out of which they came then I
only gripped them tighter still for the poor useless hate is in my soul
of those that made me in the place of doom. Yet for all the things that
my prison-clutch has held the last work that I did was to set something
free. I lay idle one night in the gloom on the warehouse floor. Nothing
stirred there and even the spider slept. Towards midnight a great flock
of echoes suddenly leapt up from the wooden planks and circled round the
roof. A man was coming towards me all alone. And as he came his soul was
reproaching him and I saw that there was a great trouble between the man
and his soul for his soul would not let him be but went on reproaching
him.

Then the man saw me and said 'This at least will not fail me.' When I
heard him say this about me I determined that whatever he might require
of me it should be done to the uttermost. And as I made this determination
in my unfaltering heart he picked me up and stood on an empty box that I
should have bound on the morrow and tied one end of me to a dark rafter;
and the knot was carelessly tied because his soul was reproaching him all
the while continually and giving him no ease. Then he made the other end
of me into a noose but when the man's soul saw this it stopped
reproaching the man and cried out to him hurriedly and besought him to
be at peace with it and to do nothing sudden; but the man went on with his
work and put the noose down over his face and underneath his chin and
the soul screamed horribly.

Then the man kicked the box away with his foot and the moment he did
this I knew that my strength was not great enough to hold him; but I
remembered that he had said I would not fail him and I put all my grim
vigour into my fibres and held by sheer will. Then the soul shouted to me
to give way but I said:

'No; you vexed the man.'

Then it screamed for me to leave go of the rafter and already I was
slipping for I only held on to it by a careless knot but I gripped with
my prison grip and said:

'You vexed the man.'

And very swiftly it said other things to me but I answered not; and at
last the soul that vexed the man that had trusted me flew away and left
him at peace. I was never able to bind things any more for every one of
my fibres was worn and wrenched and even my relentless heart was weakened
by the struggle. Very soon afterwards I was thrown out here. I have done
my work.

So they spoke among themselves but all the while there loomed above them
the form of an old rocking-horse complaining bitterly. He said: I am
Blagdaross. Woe is me that I should lie now an outcast among these worthy
but little people. Alas! for the days that are gathered and alas for the
Great One that was a master and a soul to me whose spirit is now shrunken
and can never know me again and no more ride abroad on knightly quests. I
was Bucephalus when he was Alexander and carried him victorious as far as
Ind. I encountered dragons with him when he was St. George I was the
horse of Roland fighting for Christendom and was often Rosinante. I
fought in tournays and went errant upon quests and met Ulysses and the
heroes and the fairies. Or late in the evening just before the lamps in
the nursery were put out he would suddenly mount me and we would gallop
through Africa. There we would pass by night through tropic forests and
come upon dark rivers sweeping by all gleaming with the eyes of
crocodiles where the hippopotamus floated down with the stream and
mysterious craft loomed suddenly out of the dark and furtively passed
away. And when we had passed through the forest lit by the fireflies we
would come to the open plains and gallop onwards with scarlet flamingoes
flying along beside us through the lands of dusky kings with golden
crowns upon their heads and scepters in their hands who came running out
of their palaces to see us pass. Then I would wheel suddenly and the dust
flew up from my four hooves as I turned and we galloped home again and my
master was put to bed. And again he would ride abroad on another day till
we came to magical fortresses guarded by wizardry and overthrew the
dragons at the gate and ever came back with a princess fairer than the
sea.

But my master began to grow larger in his body and smaller in his soul
and then he rode more seldom upon quests. At last he saw gold and never
came again and I was cast out here among these little people.

But while the rocking-horse was speaking two boys stole away unnoticed by
their parents from a house on the edge of the waste place and were
coming across it looking for adventures. One of them carried a broom and
when he saw the rocking-horse he said nothing but broke off the handle
from the broom and thrust it between his braces and his shirt on the left
side. Then he mounted the rocking-horse and drawing forth the broomstick
which was sharp and spiky at the end said Saladin is in this desert
with all his paynims and I am Coeur de Lion. After a while the other boy
said: Now let me kill Saladin too. But Blagdaross in his wooden heart
that exulted with thoughts of battle said: I am Blagdaross yet!




THE MADNESS OF ANDELSPRUTZ


I first saw the city of Andelsprutz on an afternoon in spring. The day was
full of sunshine as I came by the way of the fields and all that morning
I had said There will be sunlight on it when I see for the first time
the beautiful conquered city whose fame has so often made for me lovely
dreams. Suddenly I saw its fortifications lifting out of the fields and
behind them stood its belfries. I went in by a gate and saw its houses and
streets and a great disappointment came upon me. For there is an air
about a city and it has a way with it whereby a man may recognized one
from another at once. There are cities full of happiness and cities full
of pleasure and cities full of gloom. There are cities with their faces
to heaven and some with their faces to earth; some have a way of looking
at the past and others look at the future; some notice you if you come
among them others glance at you others let you go by. Some love the
cities that are their neighbours others are dear to the plains and to the
heath; some cities are bare to the wind others have purple cloaks and
others brown cloaks and some are clad in white. Some tell the old tale of
their infancy with others it is secret; some cities sing and some mutter
some are angry and some have broken hearts and each city has her way of
greeting Time.

I had said: I will see Andelsprutz arrogant with her beauty and I had
said: I will see her weeping over her conquest.

I had said: She will sing songs to me and she will be reticent she
will be all robed and she will be bare but splendid.

But the windows of Andelsprutz in her houses looked vacantly over the
plains like the eyes of a dead madman. At the hour her chimes sounded
unlovely and discordant some of them were out of tune and the bells of
some were cracked her roofs were bald and without moss. At evening no
pleasant rumour arose in her streets. When the lamps were lit in the
houses no mystical flood of light stole out into the dusk you merely saw
that there were lighted lamps; Andelsprutz had no way with her and no air
about her. When the night fell and the blinds were all drawn down then I
perceived what I had not thought in the daylight. I knew then that
Andelsprutz was dead.

I saw a fair-haired man who drank beer in a caf and I said to him:

Why is the city of Andelsprutz quite dead and her soul gone hence?

He answered: Cities do not have souls and there is never any life in
bricks.

And I said to him: Sir you have spoken truly.

And I asked the same question of another man and he gave me the same
answer and I thanked him for his courtesy. And I saw a man of a more
slender build who had black hair and channels in his cheeks for tears to
run in and I said to him:

Why is Andelsprutz quite dead and when did her soul go hence?

And he answered: Andelsprutz hoped too much. For thirty years would she
stretch out her arms toward the land of Akla every night to Mother Akla
from whom she had been stolen. Every night she would be hoping and
sighing and stretching out her arms to Mother Akla. At midnight once a
year on the anniversary of the terrible day Akla would send spies to lay
a wreath against the walls of Andelsprutz. She could do no more. And on
this night once in every year I used to weep for weeping was the mood
of the city that nursed me. Every night while other cities slept did
Andelsprutz sit brooding here and hoping till thirty wreaths lay
mouldering by her walls and still the armies of Akla could not come.

But after she had hoped so long and on the night that faithful spies had
brought her thirtieth wreath Andelsprutz went suddenly mad. All the bells
clanged hideously in the belfries horses bolted in the streets the dogs
all howled the stolid conquerors awoke and turned in their beds and slept
again; and I saw the grey shadowy form of Andelsprutz rise up decking her
hair with the phantasms of cathedrals and stride away from her city. And
the great shadowy form that was the soul of Andelsprutz went away
muttering to the mountains and there I followed her--for had she not been
my nurse? Yes I went away alone into the mountains and for three days
wrapped in a cloak I slept in their misty solitudes. I had no food to
eat and to drink I had only the water of the mountain streams. By day no
living thing was near to me and I heard nothing but the noise of the
wind and the mountain streams roaring. But for three nights I heard all
round me on the mountain the sounds of a great city: I saw the lights of
tall cathedral windows flash momentarily on the peaks and at times the
glimmering lantern of some fortress patrol. And I saw the huge misty
outline of the soul of Andelsprutz sitting decked with her ghostly
cathedrals speaking to herself with her eyes fixed before her in a mad
stare telling of ancient wars. And her confused speech for all those
nights upon the mountain was sometimes the voice of traffic and then of
church bells and then of bugles but oftenest it was the voice of red
war; and it was all incoherent and she was quite mad.

The third night it rained heavily all night long but I stayed up there
to watch the soul of my native city. And she still sat staring straight
before her raving; but here voice was gentler now there were more chimes
in it and occasional song. Midnight passed and the rain still swept down
on me and still the solitudes of the mountain were full of the mutterings
of the poor mad city. And the hours after midnight came the cold hours
wherein sick men die.

Suddenly I was aware of great shapes moving in the rain and heard the
sound of voices that were not of my city nor yet of any that I ever knew.
And presently I discerned though faintly the souls of a great concourse
of cities all bending over Andelsprutz and comforting her and the
ravines of the mountains roared that night with the voices of cities that
had lain still for centuries. For there came the soul of Camelot that had
so long ago forsaken Usk; and there was Ilion all girt with towers still
cursing the sweet face of ruinous Helen; I saw there Babylon and
Persepolis and the bearded face of bull-like Nineveh and Athens mourning
her immortal gods.

All these souls if cities that were dead spoke that night on the mountain
to my city and soothed her until at last she muttered of war no longer
and her eyes stared wildly no more but she hid her face in her hands and
for some while wept softly. At last she arose and walking slowly and with
bended head and leaning upon Ilion and Carthage went mournfully
eastwards; and the dust of her highways swirled behind her as she went a
ghostly dust that never turned to mud in all that drenching rain. And so
the souls of the cities led her away and gradually they disappeared from
the mountain and the ancient voices died away in the distance.

Now since then have I seen my city alive; but once I met with a traveler
who said that somewhere in the midst of a great desert are gathered
together the souls of all dead cities. He said that he was lost once in a
place where there was no water and he heard their voices speaking all the
night.

But I said: I was once without water in a desert and heard a city
speaking to me but knew not whether it really spoke to me or not for on
that day I heard so many terrible things and only some of them were
true.

And the man with the black hair said: I believe it to be true though
whither she went I know not. I only know that a shepherd found me in the
morning faint with hunger and cold and carried me down here; and when I
came to Andelsprutz it was as you have perceived it dead.




WHERE THE TIDES EBB AND FLOW


I dreamt that I had done a horrible thing so that burial was to be denied
me either in soil or sea neither could there be any hell for me.

I waited for some hours knowing this. Then my friends came for me and
slew me secretly and with ancient rite and lit great tapers and carried
me away.

It was all in London that the thing was done and they went furtively at
dead of night along grey streets and among mean houses until they came to
the river. And the river and the tide of the sea were grappling with one
another between the mud-banks and both of them were black and full of
lights. A sudden wonder came in to the eyes of each as my friends came
near to them with their glaring tapers. All these things I saw as they
carried me dead and stiffening for my soul was still among my bones
because there was no hell for it and because Christian burial was denied
me.

They took me down a stairway that was green with slimy things and so came
slowly to the terrible mud. There in the territory of forsaken things
they dug a shallow grave. When they had finished they laid me in the
grave and suddenly they cast their tapers to the river. And when the
water had quenched the flaring lights the tapers looked pale and small as
they bobbed upon the tide and at once the glamour of the calamity was
gone and I noticed then the approach of the huge dawn; and my friends
cast their cloaks over their faces and the solemn procession was turned
into many fugitives that furtively stole away.

Then the mud came back wearily and covered all but my face. There I lay
alone with quite forgotten things with drifting things that the tides
will take no farther with useless things and lost things and with the
horrible unnatural bricks that are neither stone nor soil. I was rid of
feeling because I had been killed but perception and thought were in my
unhappy soul. The dawn widened and I saw the desolate houses that crowded
the marge of the river and their dead windows peered into my dead eyes
windows with bales behind them instead of human souls. I grew so weary
looking at these forlorn things that I wanted to cry out but could not
because I was dead. Then I knew as I had never known before that for all
the years that herd of desolate houses had wanted to cry out too but
being dead were dumb. And I knew then that it had yet been well with the
forgotten drifting things if they had wept but they were eyeless and
without life. And I too tried to weep but there were no tears in my
dead eyes. And I knew then that the river might have cared for us might
have caressed us might have sung to us but he swept broadly onwards
thinking of nothing but the princely ships.

At last the tide did what the river would not and came and covered me
over and my soul had rest in the green water and rejoiced and believed
that it had the Burial of the Sea. But with the ebb the water fell again
and left me alone again with the callous mud among the forgotten things
that drift no more and with the sight of all those desolate houses and
with the knowledge among all of us that each was dead.

In the mournful wall behind me hung with green weeds forsaken of the
sea dark tunnels appeared and secret narrow passages that were clamped
and barred. From these at last the stealthy rats came down to nibble me
away and my soul rejoiced thereat and believed that he would be free
perforce from the accursed bones to which burial was refused. Very soon
the rats ran away a little space and whispered among themselves. They
never came any more. When I found that I was accursed even among the rats
I tried to weep again.

Then the tide came swinging back and covered the dreadful mud and hid the
desolate houses and soothed the forgotten things and my soul had ease
for a while in the sepulture of the sea. And then the tide forsook me
again.

To and fro it came about me for many years. Then the County Council found
me and gave me decent burial. It was the first grave that I had ever
slept in. That very night my friends came for me. They dug me up and put
me back again in the shallow hold in the mud.

Again and again through the years my bones found burial but always behind
the funeral lurked one of those terrible men who as soon as night fell
came and dug them up and carried them back again to the hole in the mud.

And then one day the last of those men died who once had done to me this
terrible thing. I heard his soul go over the river at sunset.

And again I hoped.

A few weeks afterwards I was found once more and once more taken out of
that restless place and given deep burial in sacred ground where my soul
hoped that it should rest.

Almost at once men came with cloaks and tapers to give me back to the mud
for the thing had become a tradition and a rite. And all the forsaken
things mocked me in their dumb hearts when they saw me carried back for
they were jealous of me because I had left the mud. It must be remembered
that I could not weep.

And the years went by seawards where the black barges go and the great
derelict centuries became lost at sea and still I lay there without any
cause to hope and daring not to hope without a cause because of the
terrible envy and the anger of the things that could drift no more.

Once a great storm rode up even as far as London out of the sea from the
South; and he came curving into the river with the fierce East wind. And
he was mightier than the dreary tides and went with great leaps over the
listless mud. And all the sad forgotten things rejoiced and mingled with
things that were haughtier than they and rode once more amongst the
lordly shipping that was driven up and down. And out of their hideous home
he took my bones never again I hoped to be vexed with the ebb and flow.
And with the fall of the tide he went riding down the river and turned to
the southwards and so went to his home. And my bones he scattered among
many isles and along the shores of happy alien mainlands. And for a
moment while they were far asunder my soul was almost free.

Then there arose at the will of the moon the assiduous flow of the tide
and it undid at once the work of the ebb and gathered my bones from the
marge of sunny isles and gleaned them all along the mainland's shores
and went rocking northwards till it came to the mouth of the Thames and
there turned westwards its relentless face and so went up the river and
came to the hole in the mud and into it dropped my bones; and partly the
mud covered them and partly it left them white for the mud cares not for
its forsaken things.

Then the ebb came and I saw the dead eyes of the houses and the jealousy
of the other forgotten things that the storm had not carried thence.

And some more centuries passed over the ebb and flow and over the
loneliness of things for gotten. And I lay there all the while in the
careless grip of the mud never wholly covered yet never able to go free
and I longed for the great caress of the warm Earth or the comfortable lap
of the Sea.

Sometimes men found my bones and buried them but the tradition never
died and my friends' successors always brought them back. At last the
barges went no more and there were fewer lights; shaped timbers no longer
floated down the fairway and there came instead old wind-uprooted trees
in all their natural simplicity.

At last I was aware that somewhere near me a blade of grass was growing
and the moss began to appear all over the dead houses. One day some
thistledown went drifting over the river.

For some years I watched these signs attentively until I became certain
that London was passing away. Then I hoped once more and all along both
banks of the river there was anger among the lost things that anything
should dare to hope upon the forsaken mud. Gradually the horrible houses
crumbled until the poor dead things that never had had life got decent
burial among the weeds and moss. At last the may appeared and the
convolvulus. Finally the wild rose stood up over mounds that had been
wharves and warehouses. Then I knew that the cause of Nature had
triumphed and London had passed away.

The last man in London came to the wall by the river in an ancient cloak
that was one of those that once my friends had worn and peered over the
edge to see that I still was there. Then he went and I never saw men
again: they had passed away with London.

A few days after the last man had gone the birds came into London all the
birds that sing. When they first saws me they all looked sideways at me
then they went away a little and spoke among themselves.

He only sinned against Man they said; it is not our quarrel.

Let us be kind to him they said.

Then they hopped nearer me and began to sing. It was the time of the
rising of the dawn and from both banks of the river and from the sky
and from the thickets that were once the streets hundreds of birds were
singing. As the light increased the birds sang more and more; they grew
thicker and thicker in the air above my head till there were thousands of
them singing there and then millions and at last I could see nothing but
a host of flickering wings with the sunlight on them and little gaps of
sky. Then when there was nothing to be heard in London but the myriad
notes of that exultant song my soul rose up from the bones in the hole in
the mud and began to climb heavenwards. And it seemed that a lane-way
opened amongst the wings of the birds and it went up and up and one of
the smaller gates of Paradise stood ajar at the end of it. And then I knew
by a sign that the mud should receive me no more for suddenly I found
that I could weep.

At this moment I opened my eyes in bed in a house in London and outside
some sparrows were twittering in a tree in the light of the radiant
morning; and there were tears still wet upon my face for one's restraint
is feeble while one sleeps. But I arose and opened the window wide and
stretching my hands out over the little garden I blessed the birds whose
song had woken me up from the troubled and terrible centuries of my dream.




BETHMOORA


There is a faint freshness in the London night as though some strayed
reveler of a breeze had left his comrades in the Kentish uplands and had
entered the town by stealth. The pavements are a little damp and shiny.
Upon one's ears that at this late hour have become very acute there hits
the tap of a remote footfall. Louder and louder grow the taps filling the
whole night. And a black cloaked figure passes by and goes tapping into
the dark. One who has danced goes homewards. Somewhere a ball has closed
its doors and ended. Its yellow lights are out its musicians are silent
its dancers have all gone into the night air and Time has said of it
Let it be past and over and among the things that I have put away.

Shadows begin to detach themselves from their great gathering places. No
less silently than those shadows that are thin and dead move homewards the
stealthy cats. Thus have we even in London our faint forebodings of the
dawn's approach which the birds and the beasts and the stars are crying
aloud to the untrammeled fields.

At what moment I know not I perceive that the night itself is irrevocably
overthrown. It is suddenly revealed to me by the weary pallor of the
street lamps that the streets are silent and nocturnal still not because
there is any strength in night but because men have not yet arisen from
sleep to defy him. So have I seen dejected and untidy guards still bearing
antique muskets in palatial gateways although the realms of the monarch
that they guard have shrunk to a single province which no enemy yet has
troubled to overrun.

And it is now manifest from the aspect of the street lamps those abashed
dependants of night that already English mountain peaks have seen the
dawn that the cliffs of Dover are standing white to the morning that the
sea-mist has lifted and is pouring inland.

And now men with a hose have come and are sluicing out the streets.

Behold now night is dead.

What memories what fancies throng one's mind! A night but just now
gathered out of London by the horrific hand of Time. A million common
artificial things all cloaked for a while in mystery like beggars robed
in purple and seated on dread thrones. Four million people asleep
dreaming perhaps. What worlds have they gone into? Whom have they met? But
my thoughts are far off with Bethmoora in her loneliness whose gates
swing to and fro. To and fro they swing and creak and creak in the wind
but no one hears them. They are of green copper very lovely but no one
sees them now. The desert wind pours sand into their hinges no watchman
comes to ease them. No guard goes round Bethmoora's battlements no enemy
assails them. There are no lights in her houses no footfall on her
streets she stands there dead and lonely beyond the Hills of Hap and I
would see Bethmoora once again but dare not.

It is many a year they tell me since Bethmoora became desolate.

Her desolation is spoken of in taverns where sailors meet and certain
travellers have told me of it.

I had hoped to see Bethmoora once again. It is many a year ago they say
when the vintage was last gathered in from the vineyards that I knew
where it is all desert now. It was a radiant day and the people of the
city were dancing by the vineyards while here and there one played upon
the kalipac. The purple flowering shrubs were all in bloom and the snow
shone upon the Hills of Hap.

Outside the copper gates they crushed the grapes in vats to make the
syrabub. It had been a goodly vintage.

In the little gardens at the desert's edge men beat the tambang and the
tittibuk and blew melodiously the zootibar.

All there was mirth and song and dance because the vintage had been
gathered in and there would be ample syrabub for the winter months and
much left over to exchange for turquoises and emeralds with the merchants
who come down from Oxuhahn. Thus they rejoiced all day over their vintage
on the narrow strip of cultivated ground that lay between Bethmoora and
the desert which meets the sky to the South. And when the heat of the day
began to abate and the sun drew near to the snows on the Hills of Hap
the note of the zootibar still rose clear from the gardens and the
brilliant dresses of the dancers still wound among the flowers. All that
day three men on mules had been noticed crossing the face of the Hills of
Hap. Backwards and forwards they moved as the track wound lower and lower
three little specks of black against the snow. They were seen first in the
very early morning up near the shoulder of Peol Jagganoth and seemed to
be coming out of Utnar Vhi. All day they came. And in the evening just
before the lights come out and colours change they appeared before
Bethmoora's copper gates. They carried staves such as messengers bear in
those lands and seemed sombrely clad when the dancers all came round them
with their green and lilac dresses. Those Europeans who were present and
heard the message given were ignorant of the language and only caught the
name of Utnar Vhi. But it was brief and passed rapidly from mouth to
mouth and almost at once the people burnt their vineyards and began to
flee away from Bethmoora going for the most part northwards though some
went to the East. They ran down out of their fair white houses and
streamed through the copper gate; the throbbing of the tambang and the
tittibuk suddenly ceased with the note of the Zootibar and the clinking
kalipac stopped a moment after. The three strange travellers went back the
way they came the instant their message was given. It was the hour when a
light would have appeared in some high tower and window after window
would have poured into the dusk its lion-frightening light and the cooper
gates would have been fastened up. But no lights came out in windows there
that night and have not ever since and those copper gates were left wide
and have never shut and the sound arose of the red fire crackling in the
vineyards and the pattering of feet fleeing softly. There were no cries
no other sounds at all only the rapid and determined flight. They fled as
swiftly and quietly as a herd of wild cattle flee when they suddenly see a
man. It was as though something had befallen which had been feared for
generations which could only be escaped by instant flight which left no
time for indecision.

Then fear took the Europeans also and they too fled. And what the message
was I have never heard.

Many believe that it was a message from Thuba Mleen the mysterious
emperor of those lands who is never seen by man advising that Bethmoora
should be left desolate. Others say that the message was one of warning
from the gods whether from friendly gods or from adverse ones they know
not.

And others hold that the Plague was ravaging a line of cities over in
Utnar Vhi following the South-west wind which for many weeks had been
blowing across them towards Bethmoora.

Some say that the terrible gnousar sickness was upon the three travellers
and that their very mules were dripping with it and suppose that they
were driven to the city by hunger but suggest no better reason for so
terrible a crime.

But most believe that it was a message from the desert himself who owns
all the Earth to the southwards spoken with his peculiar cry to those
three who knew his voice--men who had been out on the sand-wastes without
tents by night who had been by day without water men who had been out
there where the desert mutters and had grown to know his needs and his
malevolence. They say that the desert had a need for Bethmoora that he
wished to come into her lovely streets and to send into her temples and
her houses his storm-winds draped with sand. For he hates the sound and
the sight of men in his old evil heart and he would have Bethmoora silent
and undisturbed save for the weird love he whispers to her gates.

If I knew what that message was that the three men brought on mules and
told in the copper gate I think that I should go and see Bethmoora once
again. For a great longing comes on me here in London to see once more
that white and beautiful city and yet I dare not for I know not the
danger I should have to face whether I should risk the fury of unknown
dreadful gods or some disease unspeakable and slow or the desert's curse
or torture in some little private room of the Emperor Thuba Mleen or
something that the travelers have not told--perhaps more fearful still.




IDLE DAYS ON THE YANN


So I came down through the wood on the bank of Yann and found as had been
prophesied the ship _Bird of the River_ about to loose her cable.

The captain sat cross-legged upon the white deck with his scimitar lying
beside him in its jeweled scabbard and the sailors toiled to spread the
nimble sails to bring the ship into the central stream of Yann and all
the while sang ancient soothing songs. And the wind of the evening
descending cool from the snowfields of some mountainous abode of distant
gods came suddenly like glad tidings to an anxious city into the
wing-like sails.

And so we came into the central stream whereat the sailors lowered the
greater sails. But I had gone to bow before the captain and to inquire
concerning the miracles and appearances among men of the most holy gods
of whatever land he had come from. And the captain answered that he came
from fair Belzoond and worshipped gods that were the least and humblest
who seldom sent the famine or the thunder and were easily appeased with
little battles. And I told how I came from Ireland which is of Europe
whereat the captain and all the sailors laughed for they said There are
no such places in all the land of dreams. When they had ceased to mock
me I explained that my fancy mostly dwelt in the desert of Cuppar-Nombo
about a beautiful blue city called Golthoth the Damned which was
sentinelled all round by wolves and their shadows and had been utterly
desolate for years and years because of a curse which the gods once spoke
in anger and could never since recall. And sometimes my dreams took me as
far as Pungar Vees the red walled city where the fountains are which
trades with the Isles and Thul. When I said this they complimented me upon
the abode of my fancy saying that though they had never seen these
cities such places might well be imagined. For the rest of that evening I
bargained with the captain over the sum that I should pay him for any fare
if God and the tide of Yann should bring us safely as far as the cliffs by
the sea which are named Bar-Wul-Yann the Gate of Yann.

And now the sun had set and all the colours of the world and heaven had
held a festival with him and slipped one by one away before the imminent
approach of night. The parrots had all flown home to the jungle on either
bank the monkeys in rows in safety on high branches of the trees were
silent and asleep the fireflies in the deeps of the forest were going up
and down and the great stars came gleaming out to look on the face of
Yann. Then the sailors lighted lanterns and hung them round the ship and
the light flashed out on a sudden and dazzled Yann and the ducks that fed
along his marshy banks all suddenly arose and made wide circles in the
upper air and saw the distant reaches of the Yann and the white mist that
softly cloaked the jungle before they returned again to their marshes.

And then the sailors knelt on the decks and prayed not all together but
five or six at a time. Side by side there kneeled down together five or
six for there only prayed at the same time men of different faiths so
that no god should hear two men praying to him at once. As soon as any one
had finished his prayer another of the same faith would take his place.
Thus knelt the row of five or six with bended heads under the fluttering
sail while the central stream of the River Yann took them on towards the
sea and their prayers rose up from among the lanterns and went towards
the stars. And behind them in the after end of the ship the helmsman
prayed aloud the helmsman's prayer which is prayed by all who follow his
trade upon the River Yann of whatever faith they be. And the captain
prayed to his little lesser gods to the gods that bless Belzoond.

And I too felt that I would pray. Yet I liked not to pray to a jealous God
there where the frail affectionate gods whom the heathen love were being
humbly invoked; so I bethought me instead of Sheol Nugganoth whom the
men of the jungle have long since deserted who is now unworshipped and
alone; and to him I prayed.

And upon us praying the night came suddenly down as it comes upon all men
who pray at evening and upon all men who do not; yet our prayers comforted
our own souls when we thought of the Great Night to come.

And so Yann bore us magnificently onwards for he was elate with molten
snow that the Poltiades had brought him from the Hills of Hap and the
Marn and Migris were swollen with floods; and he bore us in his full might
past Kyph and Pir and we saw the lights of Goolunza.

Soon we all slept except the helmsman who kept the ship in the mid-stream
of Yann.

When the sun rose the helmsman ceased to sing for by song he cheered
himself in the lonely night. When the song ceased we suddenly all awoke
and another took the helm and the helmsman slept.

We knew that soon we should come to Mandaroon. We made a meal and
Mandaroon appeared. Then the captain commanded and the sailors loosed
again the greater sails and the ship turned and left the stream of Yann
and came into a harbour beneath the ruddy walls of Mandaroon. Then while
the sailors went and gathered fruits I came alone to the gate of
Mandaroon. A few huts were outside it in which lived the guard. A
sentinel with a long white beard was standing in the gate armed with a
rusty pike. He wore large spectacles which were covered with dust.
Through the gate I saw the city. A deathly stillness was over all of it.
The ways seemed untrodden and moss was thick on doorsteps; in the
market-place huddled figures lay asleep. A scent of incense came wafted
through the gateway of incense and burned poppies and there was a hum of
the echoes of distant bells. I said to the sentinel in the tongue of the
region of Yann Why are they all asleep in this still city?

He answered: None may ask questions in this gate for fear they will wake
the people of the city. For when the people of this city wake the gods
will die. And when the gods die men may dream no more. And I began to ask
him what gods that city worshipped but he lifted his pike because none
might ask questions there. So I left him and went back to the _Bird of the
River_.

Certainly Mandaroon was beautiful with her white pinnacles peering over
her ruddy walls and the green of her copper roofs.

When I came back again to the _Bird of the River_ I found the sailors
were returned to the ship. Soon we weighed anchor and sailed out again
and so came once more to the middle of the river. And now the sun was
moving toward his heights and there had reached us on the River Yann the
song of those countless myriads of choirs that attend him in his progress
round the world. For the little creatures that have many legs had spread
their gauze wings easily on the air as a man rests his elbows on a
balcony and gave jubilant ceremonial praises to the sun or else they
moved together on the air in wavering dances intricate and swift or
turned aside to avoid the onrush of some drop of water that a breeze had
shaken from a jungle orchid chilling the air and driving it before it as
it fell whirring in its rush to the earth; but all the while they sang
triumphantly. For the day is for us they said whether our great and
sacred father the Sun shall bring up more life like us from the marshes
or whether all the world shall end tonight. And there sang all those
whose notes are known to human ears as well as those whose far more
numerous notes have been never heard by man.

To these a rainy day had been as an era of war that should desolate
continents during all the lifetime of a man.

And there came out also from the dark and steaming jungle to behold and
rejoice in the Sun the huge and lazy butterflies. And they danced but
danced idly on the ways of the air as some haughty queen of distant
conquered lands might in her poverty and exile dance in some encampment
of the gipsies for the mere bread to live by but beyond that would never
abate her pride to dance for a fragment more.

And the butterflies sung of strange and painted things of purple orchids
and of lost pink cities and the monstrous colours of the jungle's decay.
And they too were among those whose voices are not discernible by human
ears. And as they floated above the river going from forest to forest
their splendour was matched by the inimical beauty of the birds who darted
out to pursue them. Or sometimes they settled on the white and wax-like
blooms of the plant that creeps and clambers about the trees of the
forest; and their purple wings flashed out on the great blossoms as when
the caravans go from Nurl to Thace the gleaming silks flash out upon the
snow where the crafty merchants spread them one by one to astonish the
mountaineers of the Hills of Noor.

But upon men and beasts the sun sent drowsiness. The river monsters along
the river's marge lay dormant in the slime. The sailors pitched a
pavilion with golden tassels for the captain upon the deck and then
went all but the helmsman under a sail that they had hung as an awning
between two masts. Then they told tales to one another each of his own
city or of the miracles of his god until all were fallen asleep. The
captain offered me the shade of his pavillion with the gold tassels and
there we talked for a while he telling me that he was taking merchandise
to Perdndaris and that he would take back to fair Belzoond things
appertaining to the affairs of the sea. Then as I watched through the
pavilion's opening the brilliant birds and butterflies that crossed and
recrossed over the river I fell asleep and dreamed that I was a monarch
entering his capital underneath arches of flags and all the musicians of
the world were there playing melodiously their instruments; but no one
cheered.

In the afternoon as the day grew cooler again I awoke and found the
captain buckling on his scimitar which he had taken off him while he
rested.

And now we were approaching the wide court of Astahahn which opens upon
the river. Strange boats of antique design were chained there to the
steps. As we neared it we saw the open marble court on three sides of
which stood the city fronting on colonnades. And in the court and along
the colonnades the people of that city walked with solemnity and care
according to the rites of ancient ceremony. All in that city was of
ancient device; the carving on the houses which when age had broken it
remained unrepaired was of the remotest times and everywhere were
represented in stone beasts that have long since passed away from
Earth--the dragon the griffin the hippogriffin and the different
species of gargoyle. Nothing was to be found whether material or custom
that was new in Astahahn. Now they took no notice at all of us as we went
by but continued their processions and ceremonies in the ancient city
and the sailors knowing their custom took no notice of them. But I
called as we came near to one who stood beside the water's edge asking
him what men did in Astahahn and what their merchandise was and with whom
they traded. He said Here we have fettered and manacled Time who would
otherwise slay the gods.

I asked him what gods they worshipped in that city and he said All
those gods whom Time has not yet slain. Then he turned from me and would
say no more but busied himself in behaving in accordance with ancient
custom. And so according to the will of Yann we drifted onwards and left
Astahahn. The river widened below Astahahn and we found in greater
quantities such birds as prey on fishes. And they were very wonderful in
their plumage and they came not out of the jungle but flew with their
long necks stretched out before them and their legs lying on the wind
behind straight up the river over the mid-stream.

And now the evening began to gather in. A thick white mist had appeared
over the river and was softly rising higher. It clutched at the trees
with long impalpable arms it rose higher and higher chilling the air;
and white shapes moved away into the jungle as though the ghosts of
shipwrecked mariners were searching stealthily in the darkness for the
spirits of evil that long ago had wrecked them on the Yann.

As the sun sank behind the field of orchids that grew on the matted summit
of the jungle the river monsters came wallowing out of the slime in which
they had reclined during the heat of the day and the great beasts of the
jungle came down to drink. The butterflies a while since were gone to
rest. In little narrow tributaries that we passed night seemed already to
have fallen though the sun which had disappeared from us had not yet set.

And now the birds of the jungle came flying home far over us with the
sunlight glistening pink upon their breasts and lowered their pinions as
soon as they saw the Yann and dropped into the trees. And the widgeon
began to go up the river in great companies all whistling and then would
suddenly wheel and all go down again. And there shot by us the small and
arrow-like teal; and we heard the manifold cries of flocks of geese which
the sailors told me had recently come in from crossing over the Lispasian
ranges; every year they come by the same way close by the peak of Mluna
leaving it to the left and the mountain eagles know the way they come
and--men say--the very hour and every year they expect them by the same
way as soon as the snows have fallen upon the Northern Plains. But soon it
grew so dark that we heard those birds no more and only heard the
whirring of their wings and of countless others besides until they all
settled down along the banks of the river and it was the hour when the
birds of the night went forth. Then the sailors lit the lanterns for the
night and huge moths appeared flapping about the ship and at moments
their gorgeous colours would be revealed by the lanterns then they would
pass into the night again where all was black. And again the sailors
prayed and thereafter we supped and slept and the helmsman took our
lives into his care.

When I awoke I found that we had indeed come to Perdndaris that famous
city. For there it stood upon the left of us a city fair and notable and
all the more pleasant for our eyes to see after the jungle that was so
long with us. And we were anchored by the market-place and the captain's
merchandise was all displayed and a merchant of Perdndaris stood looking
at it. And the captain had his scimitar in his hand and was beating with
it in anger upon the deck and the splinters were flying up from the white
planks; for the merchant had offered him a price for his merchandise that
the captain declared to be an insult to himself and his country's gods
whom he now said to be great and terrible gods whose curses were to be
dreaded. But the merchant waved his hands which were of great fatness
showing the pink palms and swore that of himself he thought not at all
but only of the poor folk in the huts beyond the city to whom he wished to
sell the merchandise for as low a price as possible leaving no
remuneration for himself. For the merchandise was mostly the thick
toomarund carpets that in the winter keep the wind from the floor and
tollub which the people smoke in pipes. Therefore the merchant said if he
offered a piffek more the poor folk must go without their toomarunds when
the winter came and without their tollub in the evenings or else he and
his aged father must starve together. Thereat the captain lifted his
scimitar to his own throat saying that he was now a ruined man and that
nothing remained to him but death. And while he was carefully lifting his
beard with his left hand the merchant eyed the merchandise again and
said that rather than see so worthy a captain die a man for whom he had
conceived an especial love when first he saw the manner in which he
handled his ship he and his aged father should starve together and
therefore he offered fifteen piffeks more.

When he said this the captain prostrated himself and prayed to his gods
that they might yet sweeten this merchant's bitter heart--to his little
lesser gods to the gods that bless Belzoond.

At last the merchant offered yet five piffeks more. Then the captain wept
for he said that he was deserted of his gods; and the merchant also wept
for he said that he was thinking of his aged father and of how he soon
would starve and he hid his weeping face with both his hands and eyed
the tollub again between his fingers. And so the bargain was concluded
and the merchant took the toomarund and tollub paying for them out of a
great clinking purse. And these were packed up into bales again and three
of the merchant's slaves carried them upon their heads into the city. And
all the while the sailors had sat silent cross-legged in a crescent upon
the deck eagerly watching the bargain and now a murmur of satisfaction
arose among them and they began to compare it among themselves with other
bargains that they had known. And I found out from them that there are
seven merchants in Perdndaris and that they had all come to the captain
one by one before the bargaining began and each had warned him privately
against the others. And to all the merchants the captain had offered the
wine of his own country that they make in fair Belzoond but could in no
wise persuade them to it. But now that the bargain was over and the
sailors were seated at the first meal of the day the captain appeared
among them with a cask of that wine and we broached it with care and all
made merry together. And the captain was glad in his heart because he knew
that he had much honour in the eyes of his men because of the bargain that
he had made. So the sailors drank the wine of their native land and soon
their thoughts were back in fair Belzoond and the little neighbouring
cities of Durl and Duz.

But for me the captain poured into a little jar some heavy yellow wine
from a small jar which he kept apart among his sacred things. Thick and
sweet it was even like honey yet there was in its heart a mighty ardent
fire which had authority over souls of men. It was made the captain told
me with great subtlety by the secret craft of a family of six who lived
in a hut on the mountains of Hian Min. Once in these mountains he said
he followed the spoor of a bear and he came suddenly on a man of that
family who had hunted the same bear and he was at the end of a narrow way
with precipice all about him and his spear was sticking in the bear and
the wound was not fatal and he had no other weapon. And the bear was
walking towards the man very slowly because his wound irked him--yet he
was now very close. And what he captain did he would not say but every
year as soon as the snows are hard and travelling is easy on the Hian
Min that man comes down to the market in the plains and always leaves
for the captain in the gate of fair Belzoond a vessel of that priceless
secret wine.

And as I sipped the wine and the captain talked I remembered me of
stalwart noble things that I had long since resolutely planned and my
soul seemed to grow mightier within me and to dominate the whole tide of
the Yann. It may be that I then slept. Or if I did not I do not now
minutely recollect every detail of that morning's occupations. Towards
evening I awoke and wishing to see Perdndaris before we left in the
morning and being unable to wake the captain I went ashore alone.
Certainly Perdndaris was a powerful city; it was encompassed by a wall of
great strength and altitude having in it hollow ways for troops to walk
in and battlements along it all the way and fifteen strong towers on it
in every mile and copper plaques low down where men could read them
telling in all the languages of those parts of the earth--one language on
each plaque--the tale of how an army once attacked Perdndaris and what
befell that army. Then I entered Perdndaris and found all the people
dancing clad in brilliant silks and playing on the tambang as they
danced. For a fearful thunderstorm had terrified them while I slept and
the fires of death they said had danced over Perdndaris and now the
thunder had gone leaping away large and black and hideous they said over
the distant hills and had turned round snarling at them shoving his
gleaming teeth and had stamped as he went upon the hilltops until they
rang as though they had been bronze. And often and again they stopped in
their merry dances and prayed to the God they knew not saying O God
that we know not we thank Thee for sending the thunder back to his
hills. And I went on and came to the market-place and lying there upon
the marble pavement I saw the merchant fast asleep and breathing heavily
with his face and the palms of his hands towards the sky and slaves were
fanning him to keep away the flies. And from the market-place I came to a
silver temple and then to a palace of onyx and there were many wonders in
Perdndaris and I would have stayed and seen them all but as I came to
the outer wall of the city I suddenly saw in it a huge ivory gate. For a
while I paused and admired it then I came nearer and perceived the
dreadful truth. The gate was carved out of one solid piece!

I fled at once through the gateway and down to the ship and even as I ran
I thought that I heard far off on the hills behind me the tramp of the
fearful beast by whom that mass of ivory was shed who was perhaps even
then looking for his other tusk. When I was on the ship again I felt
safer and I said nothing to the sailors of what I had seen.

And now the captain was gradually awakening. Now night was rolling up from
the East and North and only the pinnacles of the towers of Perdndaris
still took the fallen sunlight. Then I went to the captain and told him
quietly of the thing I had seen. And he questioned me at once about the
gate in a low voice that the sailors might not know; and I told him how
the weight of the thing was such that it could not have been brought from
afar and the captain knew that it had not been there a year ago. We
agreed that such a beast could never have been killed by any assault of
man and that the gate must have been a fallen tusk and one fallen near
and recently. Therefore he decided that it were better to flee at once; so
he commanded and the sailors went to the sails and others raised the
anchor to the deck and just as the highest pinnacle of marble lost the
last rays of the sun we left Perdndaris that famous city. And night came
down and cloaked Perdndaris and hid it from our eyes which as things
have happened will never see it again; for I have heard since that
something swift and wonderful has suddenly wrecked Perdndaris in a
day--towers walls and people.

And the night deepened over the River Yann a night all white with stars.
And with the night there rose the helmsman's song. As soon as he had
prayed he began to sing to cheer himself all through the lonely night. But
first he prayed praying the helmsman's prayer. And this is what I
remember of it rendered into English with a very feeble equivalent of the
rhythm that seemed so resonant in those tropic nights.

To whatever god may hear.

Wherever there be sailors whether of river or sea: whether their way be
dark or whether through storm: whether their peril be of beast or of rock:
or from enemy lurking on land or pursuing on sea: wherever the tiller is
cold or the helmsman stiff: wherever sailors sleep or helmsmen watch:
guard guide and return us to the old land that has known us: to the far
homes that we know.

To all the gods that are.

To whatever god may hear.

So he prayed and there was silence. And the sailors laid them down to
rest for the night. The silence deepened and was only broken by the
ripples of Yann that lightly touched our prow. Sometimes some monster of
the river coughed.

Silence and ripples ripples and silence again.

And then his loneliness came upon the helmsman and he began to sing. And
he sang the market songs of Durl and Duz and the old dragon-legends of
Belzoond.

Many a song he sang telling to spacious and exotic Yann the little tales
and trifles of his city of Durl. And the songs welled up over the black
jungle and came into the clear cold air above and the great bands of
stars that look on Yann began to know the affairs of Durl and Duz and of
the shepherds that dwelt in the fields between and the flocks that they
had and the loves that they had loved and all the little things that
they had hoped to do. And as I lay wrapped up in skins and blankets
listening to those songs and watching the fantastic shapes of the great
trees like to black giants stalking through the night I suddenly fell
asleep.

When I awoke great mists were trailing away from the Yann. And the flow of
the river was tumbling now tumultuously and little waves appeared; for
Yann had scented from afar the ancient crags of Glorm and knew that their
ravines lay cool before him wherein he should meet the merry wild Irillion
rejoicing from fields of snow. So he shook off from him the torpid sleep
that had come upon him in the hot and scented jungle and forgot its
orchids and its butterflies and swept on turbulent expectant strong;
and soon the snowy peaks of the Hills of Glorm came glittering into view.
And now the sailors were waking up from sleep. Soon we all ate and then
the helmsman laid him down to sleep while a comrade took his place and
they all spread over him their choicest furs.

And in a while we heard the sound that the Irillion made as she came down
dancing from the fields of snow.

And then we saw the ravine in the Hills of Glorm lying precipitous and
smooth before us into which we were carried by the leaps of Yann. And now
we left the steamy jungle and breathed the mountain air; the sailors stood
up and took deep breaths of it and thought of their own far off Acroctian
hills on which were Durl and Duz--below them in the plains stands fair
Belzoond.

A great shadow brooded between the cliffs of Glorm but the crags were
shining above us like gnarled moons and almost lit the gloom. Louder and
louder came the Irillion's song and the sound of her dancing down from
the fields of snow. And soon we saw her white and full of mists and
wreathed with rainbows delicate and small that she had plucked up near the
mountain's summit from some celestial garden of the Sun. Then she went
away seawards with the huge grey Yann and the ravine widened and opened
upon the world and our rocking ship came through to the light of the day.

And all that morning and all the afternoon we passed through the marshes
of Pondoovery; and Yann widened there and flowed solemnly and slowly and
the captain bade the sailors beat on bells to overcome the dreariness of
the marshes.

At last the Irusian mountains came in sight nursing the villages of
Pen-Kai and Blut and the wandering streets of Mlo where priests
propitiate the avalanche with wine and maize. Then night came down over
the plains of Tlun and we saw the lights of Cappadarnia. We heard the
Pathnites beating upon drums as we passed Imaut and Golzunda then all but
the helmsman slept. And villages scattered along the banks of the Yann
heard all that night in the helmsman's unknown tongue the little songs of
cities that they knew not.

I awoke before dawn with a feeling that I was unhappy before I remembered
why. Then I recalled that by the evening of the approaching day according
to all foreseen probabilities we should come to Bar-Wul-Yann and I
should part from the captain and his sailors. And I had liked the man
because he had given me of his yellow wine that was set apart among his
sacred things and many a story he had told me about his fair Belzoond
between the Acroctian hills and the Hian Min. And I had liked the ways
that his sailors had and the prayers that they prayed at evening side by
side grudging not one another their alien gods. And I had a liking too
for the tender way in which they often spoke of Durl and Duz for it is
good that men should love their native cities and the little hills that
hold those cities up.

And I had come to know who would meet them when they returned to their
homes and where they thought the meetings would take place some in a
valley of the Acroctian hills where the road comes up from Yann others in
the gateway of one or another of the three cities and others by the
fireside in the home. And I thought of the danger that had menaced us all
alike outside Perdndaris a danger that as things have happened was
very real.

And I thought too of the helmsman's cheery song in the cold and lonely
night and how he had held our lives in his careful hands. And as I
thought of this the helmsman ceased to sing and I looked up and saw a
pale light had appeared in the sky and the lonely night had passed; and
the dawn widened and the sailors awoke.

And soon we saw the tide of the Sea himself advancing resolute between
Yann's borders and Yann sprang lithely at him and they struggled awhile;
then Yann and all that was his were pushed back northward so that the
sailors had to hoist the sails and the wind being favorable we still
held onwards.

And we passed Gondara and Narl and Haz. And we saw memorable holy Golnuz
and heard the pilgrims praying.

When we awoke after the midday rest we were coming near to Nen the last
of the cities on the River Yann. And the jungle was all about us once
again and about Nen; but the great Mloon ranges stood up over all things
and watched the city from beyond the jungle.

Here we anchored and the captain and I went up into the city and found
that the Wanderers had come into Nen.

And the Wanderers were a weird dark tribe that once in every seven
years came down from the peaks of Mloon having crossed by a pass that is
known to them from some fantastic land that lies beyond. And the people of
Nen were all outside their houses and all stood wondering at their own
streets. For the men and women of the Wanderers had crowded all the ways
and every one was doing some strange thing. Some danced astounding dances
that they had learned from the desert wind rapidly curving and swirling
till the eye could follow no longer. Others played upon instruments
beautiful wailing tunes that were full of horror which souls had taught
them lost by night in the desert that strange far desert from which the
Wanderers came.

None of their instruments were such as were known in Nen nor in any part
of the region of the Yann; even the horns out of which some were made were
of beasts that none had seen along the river for they were barbed at the
tips. And they sang in the language of none songs that seemed to be akin
to the mysteries of night and to the unreasoned fear that haunts dark
places.

Bitterly all the dogs of Nen distrusted them. And the Wanderers told one
another fearful tales for though no one in Nen knew ought of their
language yet they could see the fear on the listeners' faces and as the
tale wound on the whites of their eyes showed vividly in terror as the
eyes of some little beast whom the hawk has seized. Then the teller of the
tale would smile and stop and another would tell his story and the
teller of the first tale's lips would chatter with fear. And if some
deadly snake chanced to appear the Wanderers would greet him as a brother
and the snake would seem to give his greetings to them before he passed on
again. Once that most fierce and lethal of tropic snakes the giant
lythra came out of the jungle and all down the street the central street
of Nen and none of the Wanderers moved away from him but they all played
sonorously on drums as though he had been a person of much honour; and
the snake moved through the midst of them and smote none.

Even the Wanderers' children could do strange things for if any one of
them met with a child of Nen the two would stare at each other in silence
with large grave eyes; then the Wanderers' child would slowly draw from
his turban a live fish or snake. And the children of Nen could do nothing
of that kind at all.

Much I should have wished to stay and hear the hymn with which they greet
the night that is answered by the wolves on the heights of Mloon but it
was now time to raise the anchor again that the captain might return from
Bar-Wul-Yann upon the landward tide. So we went on board and continued
down the Yann. And the captain and I spoke little for we were thinking of
our parting which should be for long and we watched instead the
splendour of the westerning sun. For the sun was a ruddy gold but a faint
mist cloaked the jungle lying low and into it poured the smoke of the
little jungle cities and the smoke of them met together in the mist and
joined into one haze which became purple and was lit by the sun as the
thoughts of men become hallowed by some great and sacred thing. Some times
one column from a lonely house would rise up higher than the cities'
smoke and gleam by itself in the sun.

And now as the sun's last rays were nearly level we saw the sight that I
had come to see for from two mountains that stood on either shore two
cliffs of pink marble came out into the river all glowing in the light of
the low sun and they were quite smooth and of mountainous altitude and
they nearly met and Yann went tumbling between them and found the sea.

And this was Bar-Wul-Yann the Gate of Yann and in the distance through
that barrier's gap I saw the azure indescribable sea where little
fishing-boats went gleaming by.

And the sun set and the brief twilight came and the exultation of the
glory of Bar-Wul-Yann was gone yet still the pink cliffs glowed the
fairest marvel that the eye beheld--and this in a land of wonders. And
soon the twilight gave place to the coming out of stars and the colours
of Bar-Wul-Yann went dwindling away. And the sight of those cliffs was to
me as some chord of music that a master's hand had launched from the
violin and which carries to Heaven or Fary the tremulous spirits of men.

And now by the shore they anchored and went no further for they were
sailors of the river and not of the sea and knew the Yann but not the
tides beyond.

And the time was come when the captain and I must part he to go back to
his fair Belzoond in sight of the distant peaks of the Hian Min and I to
find my way by strange means back to those hazy fields that all poets
know wherein stand small mysterious cottages through whose windows
looking westwards you may see the fields of men and looking eastwards
see glittering elfin mountains tipped with snow going range on range
into the region of Myth and beyond it into the kingdom of Fantasy which
pertain to the Lands of Dream. Long we regarded one another knowing that
we should meet no more for my fancy is weakening as the years slip by
and I go ever more seldom into the Lands of Dream. Then we clasped hands
uncouthly on his part for it is not the method of greeting in his
country and he commended my soul to the care of his own gods to his
little lesser gods the humble ones to the gods that bless Belzoond.




THE SWORD AND THE IDOL


It was a cold winter's evening late in the Stone Age; the sun had gone
down blazing over the plains of Thold; there were no clouds only the
chill blue sky and the imminence of stars; and the surface of the sleeping
Earth began to harden against the cold of the night. Presently from their
lairs arose and shook themselves and went stealthily forth those of
Earth's children to whom it is the law to prowl abroad as soon as the dusk
has fallen. And they went pattering softly over the plain and their eyes
shone in the dark and crossed and recrossed one another in their courses.
Suddenly there became manifest in the midst of the plain that fearful
portent of the presence of Man--a little flickering fire. And the children
of Earth who prowl abroad by night looked sideways at it and snarled and
edged away; all but the wolves who came a little nearer for it was
winter and the wolves were hungry and they had come in thousands from the
mountains and they said in their hearts We are strong. Around the fire
a little tribe was encamped. They too had come from the mountains and
from lands beyond them but it was in the mountains that the wolves first
winded them; they picked up bones at first that the tribe had dropped but
they were closer now and on all sides. It was Loz who had lit the fire. He
had killed a small furry beast hurling his stone axe at it and had
gathered a quantity of reddish-brown stones and had laid them in a long
row and placed bits of the small beast all along it; then he lit a fire
on each side and the stones heated and the bits began to cook. It was at
this time that the tribe noticed that the wolves who had followed them so
far were no longer content with the scraps of deserted encampments. A line
of yellow eyes surrounded them and when it moved it was to come nearer.
So the men of the tribe hastily tore up brushwood and felled a small tree
with their flint axes and heaped it all over the fire that Loz had made
and for a while the great heap hid the flame and the wolves came trotting
in and sat down again on their haunches much closer than before; and the
fierce and valiant dogs that belonged to the tribe believed that their end
was about to come while fighting as they had long since prophesied it
would. Then the flame caught the lofty stack of brushwood and rushed out
of it and ran up the side of it and stood up haughtily far over the top
and the wolves seeing this terrible ally of Man reveling there in his
strength and knowing nothing of this frequent treachery to his masters
went slowly away as though they had other purposes. And for the rest of
that night the dogs of the encampment cried out to them and besought them
to come back. But the tribe lay down all round the fire under thick furs
and slept. And a great wind arose and blew into the roaring heart of the
fire till it was red no longer but all pallid with heat. With the dawn
the tribe awoke.

Loz might have known that after such a mighty conflagration nothing could
remain of his small furry beast but there was hunger in him and little
reason as he searched among the ashes. What he found there amazed him
beyond measure; there was no meat there was not even his row of
reddish-brown stones but something longer than a man's leg and narrower
than his hand was lying there like a great flattened snake. When Loz
looked at its thin edges and saw that it ran to a point he picked up
stones to chip it and make it sharp. It was the instinct of Loz to sharpen
things. When he found that it could not be chipped his wonderment
increased. It was many hours before he discovered that he could sharpen
the edges by rubbing them with a stone; but at last the point was sharp
and all one side of it except near the end where Loz held it in his hand.
And Loz lifted it and brandished it and the Stone Age was over. That
afternoon in the little encampment just as the tribe moved on the Stone
Age passed away which for perhaps thirty or forty thousand years had
slowly lifted Man from among the beasts and left him with his supremacy
beyond all hope of reconquest.

It was not for many days that any other man tried to make for himself an
iron sword by cooking the same kind of small furry beast that Loz had
tried to cook. It was not for many years that any thought to lay the meat
along stones as Loz had done; and when they did being no longer on the
plains of Thold they used flints or chalk. It was not for many
generations that another piece of iron ore was melted and the secret
slowly guessed. Nevertheless one of Earth's many veils was torn aside by
Loz to give us ultimately the steel sword and the plough machinery and
factories; let us not blame Loz if we think that he did wrong for he did
all in ignorance. The tribe moved on until it came to water and there it
settled down under a hill and they built their huts there. Very soon they
had to fight with another tribe a tribe that was stronger than they; but
the sword of Loz was terrible and his tribe slew their foes. You might
make one blow at Loz but then would come one thrust from that iron sword
and there was no way of surviving it. No one could fight with Loz. And he
became ruler of the tribe in the place of Iz who hitherto had ruled it
with his sharp axe as his father had before him.

Now Loz begat Lo and in his old age gave his sword to him and Lo ruled
the tribe with it. And Lo called the name of the sword Death because it
was so swift and terrible.

And Iz begat Ird who was of no account. And Ird hated Lo because he was
of no account by reason of the iron sword of Lo.

One night Ird stole down to the hut of Lo carrying his sharp axe and he
went very softly but Lo's dog Warner heard him coming and he growled
softly by his master's door. When Ird came to the hut he heard Lo talking
gently to his sword. And Lo was saying Lie still Death. Rest rest old
sword and then What again Death? Be still. Be still.

And then again: What art thou hungry Death? Or thirsty poor old sword?
Soon Death soon. Be still only a little.

But Ird fled for he did not like the gentle tone of Lo as he spoke to his
sword.

And Lo begat Lod. And when Lo died Lod took the iron sword and ruled the
tribe.

And Ird begat Ith who was of no account like his father.

Now when Lod had smitten a man or killed a terrible beast Ith would go
away for a while into the forest rather than hear the praises that would
be given to Lod.

And once as Ith sat in the forest waiting for the day to pass he
suddenly thought he saw a tree trunk looking at him as with a face. And
Ith was afraid for trees should not look at men. But soon Ith saw that it
was only a tree and not a man though it was like a man. Ith used to speak
to this tree and tell it about Lod for he dared not speak to any one
else about him. And Ith found comfort in speaking about Lod.

One day Ith went with his stone axe into the forest and stayed there many
days.

He came back by night and the next morning when the tribe awoke they saw
something that was like a man and yet was not a man. And it sat on the
hill with its elbows pointing outwards and was quite still. And Ith was
crouching before it and hurriedly placing before it fruits and flesh and
then leaping away from it and looking frightened. Presently all the tribe
came out to see but dared not come quite close because of the fear that
they saw on the face of Ith. And Ith went to his hut and came back again
with a hunting spear-head and valuable small stone knives and reached out
and laid them before the thing that was like a man and then sprang away
from it.

And some of the tribe questioned Ith about the still thing that was like a
man and Ith said This is Ged. Then they asked Who is Ged? and Ith
said Ged sends the crops and the rain; and the sun and the moon are
Ged's.

Then the tribe went back to their huts but later in the day some came
again and they said to Ith Ged is only as we are having hands and
feet. And Ith pointed to the right hand of Ged which was not as his
left but was shaped like the paw of a beast and Ith said By this ye
may know that he is not as any man.

Then they said He is indeed Ged. But Lod said He speaketh not nor
doth he eat and Ith answered The thunder is his voice and the famine
is his eating.

After this the tribe copied Ith and brought little gifts of meat to Ged;
and Ith cooked them before him that Ged might smell the cooking.

One day a great thunderstorm came trampling up from the distance and raged
among the hills and the tribe all hid away from it in their huts. And Ith
appeared among the huts looking unafraid. And Ith said little but the
tribe thought that he had expected the terrible storm because the meat
that they had laid before Ged had been tough meat and not the best parts
of the beasts they slew.

And Ged grew to have more honour among the tribe than Lod. And Lod was
vexed.

One night Lod arose when all were asleep and quieted his dog and took
his iron sword and went away to the hill. And he came on Ged in the
starlight sitting still with his elbows pointing outwards and his
beast's paw and the mark of the fire on the ground where his food had
been cooked.

And Lod stood there for a while in great fear trying to keep to his
purpose. Suddenly he stepped up close to Ged and lifted his iron sword
and Ged neither hit nor shrank. Then the thought came into Lod's mind
Ged does not hit. What will Ged do instead?

And Lod lowered his sword and struck not and his imagination began to
work on that What will Ged do instead?

And the more Lod thought the worse was his fear of Ged.

And Lod ran away and left him.

Lod still ruled the tribe in battle or in the hunt but the chiefest
spoils of battle were given to Ged and the beasts that they slew were
Ged's; and all questions that concerned war or peace and questions of law
and disputes were always brought to him and Ith gave the answers after
speaking to Ged by night.

At last Ith said the day after an eclipse that the gifts which they
brought to Ged were not enough that some far greater sacrifice was
needed that Ged was very angry even now and not to be appeased by any
ordinary sacrifice.

And Ith said that to save the tribe from the anger of Ged he would speak
to Ged that night and ask him what new sacrifice he needed.

Deep in his heart Lod shuddered for his instinct told him that Ged wanted
Lod's only son who should hold the iron sword when Lod was gone.

No one would dare touch Lod because of the iron sword but his instinct
said in his slow mind again and again Ged loves Ith. Ith has said so.
Ith hates the sword-holders.

Ith hates the sword-holders. Ged loves Ith.

Evening fell and the night came when Ith should speak with Ged and Lod
became ever surer of the doom of his race.

He lay down but could not sleep.

Midnight had barely come when Lod arose and went with his iron sword again
to the hill.

And there sat Ged. Had Ith been to him yet? Ith whom Ged loved who hated
the sword-holders.

And Lod looked long at the old sword of iron that had come to his
grandfather on the plains of Thold.

Good-bye old sword! And Lod laid it on the knees of Ged then went away.

And when Ith came a little before dawn the sacrifice was found
acceptable unto Ged.




THE IDLE CITY


There was once a city which was an idle city wherein men told vain tales.

And it was that city's custom to tax all men that would enter in with the
toll of some idle story in the gate.

So all men paid to the watchers in the gate the toll of an idle story and
passed into the city unhindered and unhurt. And in a certain hour of the
night when the king of that city arose and went pacing swiftly up and down
the chamber of his sleeping and called upon the name of the dead queen
then would the watchers fasten up the gate and go into that chamber to the
king and sitting on the floor would tell him all the tales that they
had gathered. And listening to them some calmer mood would come upon the
king and listening still he would lie down again and at last fall asleep
and all the watchers silently would arise and steal away from the chamber.

A while ago wandering I came to the gate of that city. And even as I came
a man stood up to pay his toll to the watchers. They were seated
cross-legged on the ground between him and the gate and each one held a
spear. Near him two other travellers sat on the warm sand waiting. And the
man said:

Now the city of Nombros forsook the worship of the gods and turned
towards God. So the gods threw their cloaks over their faces and strode
away from the city and going into the haze among the hills passed through
the trunks of the olive groves into the sunset. But when they had already
left the Earth they turned and looked through the gleaming folds of the
twilight for the last time at their city; and they looked half in anger
and half in regret then turned and went away for ever. But they sent back
a Death who bore a scythe saying to it: 'Slay half in the city that
forsook us but half of them spare alive that they may yet remember their
old forsaken gods.'

But God sent a destroying angel to show that He was God saying unto him:
'Go into that city and slay half of the dwellers therein yet spare a half
of them that they may know that I am God.'

And at once the destroying angel put his hand to his sword and the sword
came out of the scabbard with a deep breath like to the breath that a
broad woodman takes before his first blow at some giant oak. Thereat the
angel pointed his arms downwards and bending his head between them fell
forward from Heaven's edge and the spring of his ankles shot him
downwards with his wings furled behind him. So he went slanting earthward
through the evening with his sword stretched out before him and he was
like a javelin that some hunter hath hurled that returneth again to the
earth: but just before he touched it he lifted his head and spread his
wings with the under feathers forward and alighted by the bank of the
broad Flavro that divides the city of Nombros. And down the bank of the
Flavro he fluttered low like to a hawk over a new-cut cornfield when the
little creatures of the corn are shelterless and at the same time down
the other bank the Death from the gods went mowing.

At once they saw each other and the angel glared at the Death and the
Death leered back at him and the flames in the eyes of the angel
illumined with a red glare the mist that lay in the hollows of the sockets
of the Death. Suddenly they fell on one another sword to scythe. And the
angel captured the temples of the gods and set up over them the sign of
God and the Death captured the temples of God and led into them the
ceremonies and sacrifices of the gods; and all the while the centuries
slipped quietly by going down the Flavro seawards.

And now some worship God in the temple of the gods and others worship the
gods in the temple of God and still the angel hath not returned again to
the rejoicing choirs and still the Death hath not gone back to die with
the dead gods; but all through Nombros they fight up and down and still
on each side of the Flavro the city lives.

And the watchers in the gate said Enter in.

Then another traveler rose up and said:

Solemnly between Huhenwazy and Nitcrana the huge grey clouds came
floating. And those great mountains heavenly Huhenwazi and Nitcrana the
king of peaks greeted them calling them brothers. And the clouds were
glad of their greeting for they meet with companions seldom in the lonely
heights of the sky.

But the vapours of evening said unto the earth-mist 'What are those
shapes that dare to move above us and to go where Nitcrana is and
Huhenwazi?'

And the earth-mist said in answer unto the vapours of evening 'It is
only an earth-mist that has become mad and has left the warm and
comfortable earth and has in his madness thought that his place is with
Huhenwazi and Nitcrana.'

'Once' said the vapours of evening 'there were clouds but this was
many and many a day ago as our forefathers have said. Perhaps the mad one
thinks he is the clouds.'

Then spake the earth-worms from the warm deeps of the mud saying 'O
earth-mist thou art indeed the clouds and there are no clouds but thou.
And as for Huhenwazi and Nitcrana I cannot see them and therefore they
are not high and there are no mountains in the world but those that I
cast up every morning out of the deeps of the mud.'

And the earth-mist and the vapours of evening were glad at the voice of
the earth-worms and looking earthward believed what they had said.

And indeed it is better to be as the earth-mist and to keep close to the
warm mud at night and to hear the earth-worm's comfortable speech and
not to be a wanderer in the cheerless heights but to leave the mountains
alone with their desolate snow to draw what comfort they can from their
vast aspect over all the cities of men and from the whispers that they
hear at evening of unknown distant gods.

And the watchers in the gate said Enter in.

Then a man stood up who came out of the west and told a western tale. He
said:

There is a road in Rome that runs through an ancient temple that once the
gods had loved; it runs along the top of a great wall and the floor of
the temple lies far down beneath it of marble pink and white.

Upon the temple floor I counted to the number of thirteen hungry cats.

'Sometimes' they said among themselves 'it was the gods that lived
here sometimes it was men and now it's cats. So let us enjoy the sun on
the hot marble before another people comes.'

For it was at that hour of a warm afternoon when my fancy is able to hear
silent voices.

And the awful leanness of all those thirteen cats moved me to go into a
neighbouring fish shop and there to buy a quantity of fishes. Then I
returned and threw them all over the railing at the top of the great wall
and they fell for thirty feet and hit the sacred marble with a smack.

Now in any other town but Rome or in the minds of any other cats the
sight of fishes falling out of heaven had surely excited wonder. They rose
slowly and all stretched themselves then they came leisurely towards the
fishes. 'It is only a miracle' they said in their hearts.

And the watchers in the gate said Enter in.

Proudly and slowly as they spoke drew up to them a camel whose rider
sought entrance to the city. His face shone with the sunset by which for
long he had steered for the city's gate. Of him they demanded toll.
Whereat he spoke to his camel and the camel roared and kneeled and the
man descended from him. And the man unwrapped from many silks a box of
divers metals wrought by the Japanese and on the lid of it were figures
of men who gazed from some shore at an isle of the Inland Sea. This he
showed to the watchers and when they had seen it said It has seemed to
me that these speak to each other thus:

'Behold now Oojni the dear one of the sea the little mother sea that
hath no storms. She goeth out from Oojni singing a song and she returneth
singing over her sands. Little is Oojni in the lap of the sea and scarce
to be perceived by wondering ships. White sails have never wafted her
legends afar they are told not by bearded wanderers of the sea. Her
fireside tales are known not to the North the dragons of China have not
heard of them nor those that ride on elephants through Ind.

'Men tell the tales and the smoke ariseth upwards; the smoke departeth
and the tales are told.

'Oojni is not a name among the nations she is not know of where the
merchants meet she is not spoken of by alien lips.

'Indeed but Oojni is a little among the isles yet is she loved by those
that know her coasts and her inland places hidden from the sea.

Without glory without fame and without wealth Oojni is greatly loved
by a little people and by a few; yet not by few for all her dead still
love her and oft by night come whispering through her woods. Who could
forget Oojni even among the dead?

For here in Oojni wot you are homes of men and gardens and golden
temples of the gods and sacred places inshore from the sea and many
murmurous woods. And there is a path that winds over the hills to go into
mysterious holy lands where dance by night the spirits of the woods or
sing unseen in the sunlight; and no one goes into these holy lands for
who that love Oojni could rob her of her mysteries and the curious aliens
come not. Indeed but we love Oojni though she is so little; she is the
little mother of our race and the kindly nurse of all seafaring birds.

And behold even now caressing her the gentle fingers of the mother sea
whose dreams are far with that old wanderer Ocean.

And yet let us forget not Fuzi-Yama for he stands manifest over clouds
and sea misty below and vague and indistinct but clear above for all
the isles to watch. The ships make all their journeys in his sight the
nights and the days go by him like a wind the summers and winters under
him flicker and fade the lives of men pass quietly here and hence and
Fuzi-Yama watches there--and knows.

And the watchers in the gate said Enter in.

And I too would have told them a tale very wonderful and very true; one
that I had told in many cities which as yet had no believers. But now the
sun had set and the brief twilight gone and ghostly silences were rising
from far and darkening hills. A stillness hung over that city's gate. And
the great silence of the solemn night was more acceptable to the watchers
in the gate than any sound of man. Therefore they beckoned to us and
motioned with their hands that we should pass untaxed into the city. And
softly we went up over the sand and between the high rock pillars of the
gate and a deep stillness settled among the watchers and the stars over
them twinkled undisturbed.

For how short a while man speaks and withal how vainly. And for how long
he is silent. Only the other day I met a king in Thebes who had been
silent already for four thousand years.




THE HASHISH MAN


I was at a dinner in London the other day. The ladies had gone upstairs
and no one sat on my right; on my left there was a man I did not know but
he knew my name somehow apparently for he turned to me after a while and
said I read a story of yours about Bethmoora in a review.

Of course I remembered the tale. It was about a beautiful Oriental city
that was suddenly deserted in a day--nobody quite knew why. I said Oh
yes and slowly searched in my mind for some more fitting acknowledgment
of the compliment that his memory had paid me.

I was greatly astonished when he said You were wrong about the gnousar
sickness; it was not that at all.

I said Why! Have you been there?

And he said Yes; I do it with hashish. I know Bethmoora well. And he
took out of his pocket a small box full of some black stuff that looked
like tar but had a stranger smell. He warned me not to touch it with my
finger as the stain remained for days. I got it from a gipsy he said.
He had a lot of it as it had killed his father. But I interrupted him
for I wanted to know for certain what it was that had made desolate that
beautiful city Bethmoora and why they fled from it swiftly in a day.
Was it because of the Desert's curse? I asked. And he said Partly it
was the fury of the Desert and partly the advice of the Emperor Thuba
Mleen for that fearful beast is in some way connected with the Desert on
his mother's side. And he told me this strange story: You remember the
sailor with the black scar who was there on the day that you described
when the messengers came on mules to the gate of Bethmoora and all the
people fled. I met this man in a tavern drinking rum and he told me all
about the flight from Bethmoora but knew no more than you did what the
message was or who had sent it. However he said he would see Bethmoora
once more whenever he touched again at an eastern port even if he had to
face the Devil. He often said that he would face the Devil to find out the
mystery of that message that emptied Bethmoora in a day. And in the end he
had to face Thuba Mleen whose weak ferocity he had not imagined. For one
day the sailor told me he had found a ship and I met him no more after
that in the tavern drinking rum. It was about that time that I got the
hashish from the gipsy who had a quantity that he did not want. It takes
one literally out of oneself. It is like wings. You swoop over distant
countries and into other worlds. Once I found out the secret of the
universe. I have forgotten what it was but I know that the Creator does
not take Creation seriously for I remember that He sat in Space with all
His work in front of Him and laughed. I have seen incredible things in
fearful worlds. As it is your imagination that takes you there so it is
only by your imagination that you can get back. Once out in aether I met a
battered prowling spirit that had belonged to a man whom drugs had
killed a hundred years ago; and he led me to regions that I had never
imagined; and we parted in anger beyond the Pleiades and I could not
imagine my way back. And I met a huge grey shape that was the Spirit of
some great people perhaps of a whole star and I besought It to show me
my way home and It halted beside me like a sudden wind and pointed and
speaking quite softly asked me if I discerned a certain tiny light and I
saw a far star faintly and then It said to me 'That is the Solar
System' and strode tremendously on. And somehow I imagined my way back
and only just in time for my body was already stiffening in a chair in my
room; and the fire had gone out and everything was cold and I had to move
each finger one by one and there were pins and needles in them and
dreadful pains in the nails which began to thaw; and at last I could move
one arm and reached a bell and for a long time no one came because
every one was in bed. But at last a man appeared and they got a doctor;
and HE said that it was hashish poisoning but it would have been all
right if I hadn't met that battered prowling spirit.

I could tell you astounding things that I have seen but you want to know
who sent that message to Bethmoora. Well it was Thuba Mleen. And this is
how I know. I often went to the city after that day you wrote of (I used
to take hashish of an evening in my flat) and I always found it
uninhabited. Sand had poured into it from the desert and the streets were
yellow and smooth and through open swinging doors the sand had drifted.

One evening I had put the guard in front of the fire and settled into a
chair and eaten my hashish and the first thing that I saw when I came to
Bethmoora was the sailor with the black scar strolling down the street
and making footprints in the yellow sand. And now I knew that I should see
what secret power it was that kept Bethmoora uninhabited.

I saw that there was anger in the Desert for there were storm clouds
heaving along the skyline and I heard a muttering amongst the sand.

The sailor strolled on down the street looking into the empty houses as
he went; sometimes he shouted and sometimes he sang and sometimes he
wrote his name on a marble wall. Then he sat down on a step and ate his
dinner. After a while he grew tired of the city and came back up the
street. As he reached the gate of green copper three men on camels
appeared.

I could do nothing. I was only a consciousness invisible wandering: my
body was in Europe. The sailor fought well with his fists but he was
over-powered and bound with ropes and led away through the Desert.

I followed for as long as I could stay and found that they were going by
the way of the Desert round the Hills of Hap towards Utnar Vhi and then
I knew that the camel men belonged to Thuba Mleen.

I work in an insurance office all day and I hope you won't forget me if
ever you want to insure--life fire or motor--but that's no part of my
story. I was desperately anxious to get back to my flat though it is not
good to take hashish two days running; but I wanted to see what they would
do to the poor fellow for I had heard bad rumours about Thuba Mleen. When
at last I got away I had a letter to write; then I rang for my servant
and told him that I must not be disturbed though I left my door unlocked
in case of accidents. After that I made up a good fire and sat down and
partook of the pot of dreams. I was going to the palace of Thuba Mleen.

I was kept back longer than usual by noises in the street but suddenly I
was up above the town; the European countries rushed by beneath me and
there appeared the thin white palace spires of horrible Thuba Mleen. I
found him presently at the end of a little narrow room. A curtain of red
leather hung behind him on which all the names of God written in
Yannish were worked with a golden thread. Three windows were small and
high. The Emperor seemed no more than about twenty and looked small and
weak. No smiles came on his nasty yellow face though he tittered
continually. As I looked from his low forehead to his quivering under lip
I became aware that there was some horror about him though I was not able
to perceive what it was. And then I saw it--the man never blinked; and
though later on I watched those eyes for a blink it never happened once.

And then I followed the Emperor's rapt glance and I saw the sailor lying
on the floor alive but hideously rent and the royal torturers were at
work all round him. They had torn long strips from him but had not
detached them and they were torturing the ends of them far away from the
sailor. The man that I met at dinner told me many things which I must
omit. The sailor was groaning softly and every time he groaned Thuba
Mleen tittered. I had no sense of smell but I could hear and see and I
do not know which was the most revolting--the terrible condition of the
sailor or the happy unblinking face of horrible Thuba Mleen.

I wanted to go away but the time was not yet come and I had to stay
where I was.

Suddenly the Emperor's face began to twitch violently and his under lip
quivered faster and he whimpered with anger and cried with a shrill
voice in Yannish to the captain of his torturers that there was a spirit
in the room. I feared not for living men cannot lay hands on a spirit
but all the torturers were appalled at his anger and stopped their work
for their hands trembled in fear. Then two men of the spear-guard slipped
from the room and each of them brought back presently a golden bowl with
knobs on it full of hashish; and the bowls were large enough for heads to
have floated in had they been filled with blood. And the two men fell to
rapidly each eating with two great spoons--there was enough in each
spoonful to have given dreams to a hundred men. And there came upon them
soon the hashish state and their spirits hovered preparing to go free
while I feared horribly but ever and anon they fell back again to their
bodies recalled by some noise in the room. Still the men ate but lazily
now and without ferocity. At last the great spoons dropped out of their
hands and their spirits rose and left them. I could not flee. And the
spirits were more horrible than the men because they were young men and
not yet wholly moulded to fit their fearful souls. Still the sailor
groaned softly evoking little titters from the Emperor Thuba Mleen. Then
the two spirits rushed at me and swept me thence as gusts of wind sweep
butterflies and away we went from that small pale heinous man. There
was no escaping from these spirits' fierce insistence. The energy in my
minute lump of the drug was overwhelmed by the huge spoonsful that these
men had eaten with both hands. I was whirled over Arvle Woondery and
brought to the lands of Snith and swept on still until I came to Kragua
and beyond this to those bleak lands that are nearly unknown to fancy. And
we came at last to those ivory hills that are named the Mountains of
Madness and I tried to struggle against the spirits of that frightful
Emperor's men for I heard on the other side of the ivory hills the
pittering of those beasts that prey on the mad as they prowled up and
down. It was no fault of mine that my little lump of hashish could not
fight with their horrible spoonsful....

Some one was tugging at the hall-door bell. Presently a servant came and
told our host that a policeman in the hall wished to speak to him at once.
He apologised to us and went outside and we heard a man in heavy boots
who spoke in a low voice to him. My friend got up and walked over to the
window and opened it and looked outside. I should think it will be a
fine night he said. Then he jumped out. When we put our astonished heads
out of the window to look for him he was already out of sight.




POOR OLD BILL


On an antique haunt of sailors a tavern of the sea the light of day was
fading. For several evenings I had frequented this place in the hope of
hearing something from the sailors as they sat over strange wines about
a rumour that had reached my ears of a certain fleet of galleons of old
Spain still said to be afloat in the South Seas in some uncharted region.

In this I was again to be disappointed. Talk was low and seldom and I was
about to leave when a sailor wearing ear-rings of pure gold lifted up
his head from his wine and looking straight before him at the wall told
his tale loudly:

(When later on a storm of rain arose and thundered on the tavern's leaded
panes he raised his voice without effort and spoke on still. The darker
it got the clearer his wild eyes shone.)

A ship with sails of the olden time was nearing fantastic isles. We had
never seen such isles.

We all hated the captain and he hated us. He hated us all alike there
was no favouritism about him. And he never would talk a word with any of
us except sometimes in the evening when it was getting dark he would stop
and look up and talk a bit to the men he had hanged at the yard-arm.

We were a mutinous crew. But Captain was the only man that had pistols.
He slept with one under his pillow and kept one close beside him. There
was a nasty look about the isles. They were small and flat as though they
had come up only recently from the sea and they had no sand or rocks like
honest isles but green grass down to the water. And there were little
cottages there whose looks we did not like. Their thatches came almost
down to the ground and were strangely turned up at the corners and under
the low eaves were queer dark windows whose little leaded panes were too
thick to see through. And no one man or beast was walking about so that
you could not know what kind of people lived there. But Captain knew. And
he went ashore and into one of the cottages and someone lit lights
inside and the little windows wore an evil look.

It was quite dark when he came aboard again and he bade a cheery
good-night to the men that swung from the yard-arm and he eyed us in a way
that frightened poor old Bill.

Next night we found that he had learned to curse for he came on a lot of
us asleep in our bunks and among them poor old Bill and he pointed at us
with a finger and made a curse that our souls should stay all night at
the top of the masts. And suddenly there was the soul of poor old Bill
sitting like a monkey at the top of the mast and looking at the stars
and freezing through and through.

We got up a little mutiny after that but Captain comes up and points
with his finger again and this time poor old Bill and all the rest are
swimming behind the ship through the cold green water though their bodies
remain on deck.

It was the cabin-boy who found out that Captain couldn't curse when he
was drunk though he could shoot as well at one time as another.

After that it was only a matter of waiting and of losing two men when
the time came. Some of us were murderous fellows and wanted to kill
Captain but poor old Bill was for finding a bit of an island out of the
track of ships and leaving him there with his share of our year's
provisions. And everybody listened to poor old Bill and we decided to
maroon Captain as soon as we caught him when he couldn't curse.

It was three whole days before Captain got drunk again and poor old Bill
and all had a dreadful time for Captain invented new curses every day
and wherever he pointed his finger our souls had to go; and the fishes got
to know us and so did the stars and none of them pitied us when we froze
on the masts or were hurried through forests of seaweed and lost our
way--both stars and fishes went about their businesses with cold
unastonished eyes. Once when the sun had set and it was twilight and the
moon was showing clearer and clearer in the sky and we stopped our work
for a moment because Captain seemed to be looking away from us at the
colours in the sky he suddenly turned and sent our souls to the Moon. And
it was colder there than ice at night; and there were horrible mountains
making shadows; and it was all as silent as miles of tombs; and Earth was
shining up in the sky as big as the blade of a scythe and we all got
homesick for it but could not speak nor cry. It was quite dark when we
got back and we were very respectful to Captain all the next day but he
cursed several of us again very soon. What we all feared most was that he
would curse our souls to Hell and none of us mentioned Hell above a
whisper for fear that it should remind him. But on the third evening the
cabin-boy came and told us that Captain was drunk. And we all went to his
cabin and we found him lying there across his bunk and he shot as he had
never shot before; but he had no more than the two pistols and he would
only have killed two men if he hadn't caught Joe over the head with the
end of one of his pistols. And then we tied him up. And poor old Bill put
the rum between the Captain's teeth and kept him drunk for two days so
that he could not curse till we found a convenient rock. And before
sunset of the second day we found a nice bare island for Captain out of
the track of ships about a hundred yards long and about eighty wide; and
we rowed him along to it in a little boat and gave him provisions for a
year the same as we had ourselves because poor old Bill wanted to be
fair. And we left him sitting comfortable with his back to a rock singing
a sailor's song.

When we could no longer hear Captain singing we all grew very cheerful
and made a banquet out of our year's provisions as we all hoped to be
home again in under three weeks. We had three great banquets every day for
a week--every man had more than he could eat and what was left over we
threw on the floor like gentlemen. And then one day as we saw San
Hugdos and wanted to sail in to spend our money the wind changed round
from behind us and beat us out to sea. There was no tacking against it
and no getting into the harbour though other ships sailed by us and
anchored there. Sometimes a dead calm would fall on us while fishing
boats all around us flew before half a gale and sometimes the wind would
beat us out to sea when nothing else was moving. All day we tried and at
night we laid to and tried again the next day. And all the sailors of the
other ships were spending their money in San Hugdos and we could not
come nigh it. Then we spoke horrible things against the wind and against
San Hugdos and sailed away.

It was just the same at Norenna.

We kept close together now and talked in low voices. Suddenly poor old
Bill grew frightened. As we went all along the Siractic coast-line we
tried again and again and the wind was waiting for us in every harbour
and sent us out to sea. Even the little islands would not have us. And
then we knew that there was no landing yet for poor old Bill and every
one upbraided his kind heart that had made them maroon Captain on a rock
so as not to have his blood upon their heads. There was nothing to do but
to drift about the seas. There were no banquets now because we feared
that Captain might live his year and keep us out to sea.

At first we used to hail all passing ships and used to try to board them
in the boats; but there was no towing against Captain's curse and we had
to give that up. So we played cards for a year in Captain's cabin night
and day storm and fine and every one promised to pay poor old Bill when
we got ashore.

It was horrible to us to think what a frugal man Captain really was he
that used to get drunk every other day whenever he was at sea and here he
was still alive and sober too for his curse still kept us out of every
port and our provisions were gone.

Well it came to drawing lots and Jim was the unlucky one. Jim only kept
us about three days and then we drew lots again and this time it was the
nigger. The nigger didn't keep us any longer and we drew again and this
time it was Charlie and still Captain was alive.

As we got fewer one of us kept us longer. Longer and longer a mate used
to last us and we all wondered how ever Captain did it. It was five weeks
over the year when we drew Mike and he kept us for a week and Captain
was still alive. We wondered he didn't get tired of the same old curse;
but we supposed things looked different when one is alone on an island.

When there was only Jakes and poor old Bill and the cabin-boy and Dick
we didn't draw any longer. We said that the cabin-boy had had all the
luck and he mustn't expect any more. Then poor old Bill was alone with
Jakes and Dick and Captain was still alive. When there was no more boy
and the Captain still alive Dick who was a huge strong man like poor old
Bill said that it was Jakes' turn and he was very lucky to have lived as
long as he had. But poor old Bill talked it all over with Jakes and they
thought it better than Dick should take his turn.

Then there was Jakes and poor old Bill; and Captain would not die.

And these two used to watch one another night and day when Dick was gone
and no one else was left to them. And at last poor old Bill fell down in a
faint and lay there for an hour. Then Jakes came up to him slowly with his
knife and makes a stab at poor old Bill as he lies there on the deck. And
poor old Bill caught hold of him by the wrist and put his knife into him
twice to make quite sure although it spoiled the best part of the meat.
Then poor old Bill was all alone at sea.

And the very next week before the food gave out Captain must have died
on his bit of an island; for poor old Bill heard the Captain's soul going
cursing over the sea and the day after that the ship was cast on a rocky
coast.

And Captain's been dead now for over a hundred years and poor old Bill
is safe ashore again. But it looks as if Captain hadn't done with him yet
for poor old Bill doesn't ever get any older and somehow or other he
doesn't seem to die. Poor old Bill!

When this was over the man's fascination suddenly snapped and we all
jumped up and left him.

It was not only his revolting story but it was the fearful look in the
eyes of the man who told it and the terrible ease with which his voice
surpassed the roar of the rain that decided me never again to enter that
haunt of sailors--the tavern of the sea.




THE BEGGARS


I was walking down Piccadilly not long ago thinking of nursery rhymes and
regretting old romance.

As I saw the shopkeepers walk by in their black frock-coats and their
black hats I thought of the old line in nursery annals: The merchants of
London they wear scarlet.

The streets were all so unromantic dreary. Nothing could be done for
them I thought--nothing. And then my thoughts were interrupted by barking
dogs. Every dog in the street seemed to be barking--every kind of dog not
only the little ones but the big ones too. They were all facing East
towards the way I was coming by. Then I turned round to look and had this
vision in Piccadilly on the opposite side to the houses just after you
pass the cab-rank.

Tall bent men were coming down the street arrayed in marvelous cloaks. All
were sallow of skin and swarthy of hair and most of them wore strange
beards. They were coming slowly and they walked with staves and their
hands were out for alms.

All the beggars had come to town.

I would have given them a gold doubloon engraven with the towers of
Castile but I had no such coin. They did not seem the people to who it
were fitting to offer the same coin as one tendered for the use of a
taxicab (O marvelous ill-made word surely the pass-word somewhere of
some evil order). Some of them wore purple cloaks with wide green borders
and the border of green was a narrow strip with some and some wore cloaks
of old and faded red and some wore violet cloaks and none wore black.
And they begged gracefully as gods might beg for souls.

I stood by a lamp-post and they came up to it and one addressed it
calling the lamp-post brother and said O lamp-post our brother of the
dark are there many wrecks by thee in the tides of night? Sleep not
brother sleep not. There were many wrecks an it were not for thee.

It was strange: I had not thought of the majesty of the street lamp and
his long watching over drifting men. But he was not beneath the notice of
these cloaked strangers.

And then one murmured to the street: Art thou weary street? Yet a little
longer they shall go up and down and keep thee clad with tar and wooden
bricks. Be patient street. In a while the earthquake cometh.

Who are you? people said. And where do you come from?

Who may tell what we are they answered or whence we come?

And one turned towards the smoke-stained houses saying Blessed be the
houses because men dream therein.

Then I perceived what I had never thought that all these staring houses
were not alike but different one from another because they held
different dreams.

And another turned to a tree that stood by the Green Park railings
saying Take comfort tree for the fields shall come again.

And all the while the ugly smoke went upwards the smoke that has stifled
Romance and blackened the birds. This I thought they can neither praise
nor bless. And when they saw it they raised their hands towards it
towards the thousand chimneys saying Behold the smoke. The old
coal-forests that have lain so long in the dark and so long still are
dancing now and going back to the sun. Forget not Earth O our brother
and we wish thee joy of the sun.

It had rained and a cheerless stream dropped down a dirty gutter. It had
come from heaps of refuse foul and forgotten; it had gathered upon its
way things that were derelict and went to somber drains unknown to man or
the sun. It was this sullen stream as much as all other causes that had
made me say in my heart that the town was vile that Beauty was dead in
it and Romance fled.

Even this thing they blessed. And one that wore a purple cloak with broad
green border said Brother be hopeful yet for thou shalt surely come
at last to the delectable Sea and meet the heaving huge and travelled
ships and rejoice by isles that know the golden sun. Even thus they
blessed the gutter and I felt no whim to mock.

And the people that went by in their black unseemly coats and their
misshapen monstrous shiny hats the beggars also blessed. And one of
them said to one of these dark citizens: O twin of Night himself with
thy specks of white at wrist and neck like to Night's scattered stars. How
fearfully thou dost veil with black thy hid unguessed desires. They are
deep thoughts in thee that they will not frolic with colour that they say
'No' to purple and to lovely green 'Begone.' Thou hast wild fancies that
they must needs be tamed with black and terrible imaginings that they
must be hidden thus. Has thy soul dreams of the angels and of the walls
of fary that thou hast guarded it so utterly lest it dazzle astonished
eyes? Even so God hid the diamond deep down in miles of clay.

The wonder of thee is not marred by mirth.

Behold thou art very secret.

Be wonderful. Be full of mystery.

Silently the man in the black frock-coat passed on. And I came to
understand when the purple beggar had spoken that the dark citizen had
trafficked perhaps with Ind that in his heart were strange and dumb
ambitions; that his dumbness was founded by solemn rite on the roots of
ancient tradition; that it might be overcome one day by a cheer in the
street or by some one singing a song and that when this shopman spoke
there might come clefts in the world and people peering over at the abyss.

Then turning towards Green Park where as yet Spring was not the beggars
stretched out their hands and looking at the frozen grass and the yet
unbudding trees they chanting all together prophesied daffodils.

A motor omnibus came down the street nearly running over some of the dogs
that were barking ferociously still. It was sounding its horn noisily.

And the vision went then.




_In a letter from a friend whom I have never seen one of those that read
my books this line was quoted--But he he never came to Carcassonne. I
do not know the origin of the line but I made this tale about it._


CARCASSONNE


When Camorak reigned at Arn and the world was fairer he gave a festival
to all the weald to commemorate the splendour of his youth.

They say that his house at Arn was huge and high and its ceiling painted
blue; and when evening fell men would climb up by ladders and light the
scores of candles hanging from slender chains. And they say too that
sometimes a cloud would come and pour in through the top of one of the
oriel windows and it would come over the edge of the stonework as the
sea-mist comes over a sheer cliffs shaven lip where an old wind has blown
for ever and ever (he has swept away thousands of leaves and thousands of
centuries they are all one to him he owes no allegiance to Time). And
the cloud would re-shape itself in the hall's lofty vault and drift on
through it slowly and out to the sky again through another window. And
from its shape the knights in Camorak's hall would prophesy the battles
and sieges of the next season of war. They say of the hall of Camorak at
Arn that there hath been none like it in any land and foretell that there
will be never.

Hither had come in the folk of the Weald from sheepfold and from forest
revolving slow thoughts of food and shelter and love and they sat down
wondering in that famous hall; and therein also were seated the men of
Arn the town that clustered round the King's high house and all was
roofed with red maternal earth.

If old songs may be trusted it was a marvelous hall.

Many who sat there could only have seen it distantly before a clear shape
in the landscape but smaller than a hill. Now they beheld along the wall
the weapons of Camorak's men of which already the lute-players made
songs and tales were told at evening in the byres. There they described
the shield of Camorak that had gone to and fro across so many battles and
the sharp but dinted edges of his sword; there were the weapons of Gadriol
the Leal and Norn and Athoric of the Sleety Sword Heriel the Wild
Yarold and Thanga of Esk their arms hung evenly all round the hall low
where a man could reach them; and in the place of honour in the midst
between the arms of Camorak and of Gadriol the Leal hung the harp of
Arleon. And of all the weapons hanging on those walls none were more
calamitous to Camorak's foes than was the harp of Arleon. For to a man
that goes up against a strong place on foot pleasant indeed is the twang
and jolt of some fearful engine of war that his fellow-warriors are
working behind him from which huge rocks go sighing over his head and
plunge among his foes; and pleasant to a warrior in the wavering light are
the swift commands of his King and a joy to him are his comrades' instant
cheers exulting suddenly at a turn of the war. All this and more was the
harp to Camorak's men; for not only would it cheer his warriors on but
many a time would Arleon of the Harp strike wild amazement into opposing
hosts by some rapturous prophecy suddenly shouted out while his hand swept
over the roaring strings. Moreover no war was ever declared till Camorak
and his men had listened long to the harp and were elate with the music
and mad against peace. Once Arleon for the sake of a rhyme had made war
upon Estabonn; and an evil king was overthrown and honour and glory won;
from such queer motives does good sometimes accrue.

Above the shields and the harps all round the hall were the painted
figures of heroes of fabulous famous songs. Too trivial because too
easily surpassed by Camorak's men seemed all the victories that the earth
had known; neither was any trophy displayed of Camorak's seventy battles
for these were as nothing to his warriors or him compared with those
things that their youth had dreamed and which they mightily purposed yet
to do.

Above the painted pictures there was darkness for evening was closing in
and the candles swinging on their slender chain were not yet lit in the
roof; it was as though a piece of the night had been builded into the
edifice like a huge natural rock that juts into a house. And there sat all
the warriors of Arn and the Weald-folk wondering at them; and none were
more than thirty and all were skilled in war. And Camorak sat at the head
of all exulting in his youth.

We must wrestle with Time for some seven decades and he is a weak and
puny antagonist in the first three bouts.

Now there was present at this feast a diviner one who knew the schemes of
Fate and he sat among the people of the Weald and had no place of honour
for Camorak and his men had no fear of Fate. And when the meat was eaten
and the bones cast aside the king rose up from his chair and having
drunken wine and being in the glory of his youth and with all his knights
about him called to the diviner saying Prophesy.

And the diviner rose up stroking his grey beard and spake
guardedly--There are certain events he said upon the ways of Fate
that are veiled even from a diviner's eyes and many more are clear to us
that were better veiled from all; much I know that is better unforetold
and some things that I may not foretell on pain of centuries of
punishment. But this I know and foretell--that you will never come to
Carcassonne.

Instantly there was a buzz of talk telling of Carcassonne--some had heard
of it in speech or song some had read of it and some had dreamed of it.
And the king sent Arleon of the Harp down from his right hand to mingle
with the Weald-folk to hear aught that any told of Carcassonne. But the
warriors told of the places they had won to--many a hard-held fortress
many a far-off land and swore that they would come to Carcassonne.

And in a while came Arleon back to the king's right hand and raised his
harp and chanted and told of Carcassonne. Far away it was and far and far
away a city of gleaming ramparts rising one over other and marble
terraces behind the ramparts and fountains shimmering on the terraces. To
Carcassonne the elf-kings with their fairies had first retreated from men
and had built it on an evening late in May by blowing their elfin horns.
Carcassonne! Carcassonne!

Travellers had seen it sometimes like a clear dream with the sun
glittering on its citadel upon a far-off hilltop and then the clouds had
come or a sudden mist; no one had seen it long or come quite close to it;
though once there were some men that came very near and the smoke from
the houses blew into their faces a sudden gust--no more and these
declared that some one was burning cedarwood there. Men had dreamed that
there is a witch there walking alone through the cold courts and
corridors of marmorean palaces fearfully beautiful and still for all her
fourscore centuries singing the second oldest song which was taught her
by the sea shedding tears for loneliness from eyes that would madden
armies yet will she not call her dragons home--Carcassonne is terribly
guarded. Sometimes she swims in a marble bath through whose deeps a river
tumbles or lies all morning on the edge of it to dry slowly in the sun
and watches the heaving river trouble the deeps of the bath. It flows
through the caverns of earth for further than she knows and coming to
light in the witch's bath goes down through the earth again to its own
peculiar sea.

In autumn sometimes it comes down black with snow that spring has molten
in unimagined mountains or withered blooms of mountain shrubs go
beautifully by.

When there is blood in the bath she knows there is war in the mountains;
and yet she knows not where those mountains are.

When she sings the fountains dance up from the dark earth when she combs
her hair they say there are storms at sea when she is angry the wolves
grow brave and all come down to the byres when she is sad the sea is sad
and both are sad for ever. Carcassonne! Carcassonne!

This city is the fairest of the wonders of Morning; the sun shouts when he
beholdeth it; for Carcassonne Evening weepeth when Evening passeth away.

And Arleon told how many goodly perils were round about the city and how
the way was unknown and it was a knightly venture. Then all the warriors
stood up and sang of the splendour of the venture. And Camorak swore by
the gods that had builded Arn and by the honour of his warriors that
alive or dead he would come to Carcassonne.

But the diviner rose and passed out of the hall brushing the crumbs from
him with his hands and smoothing his robe as he went.

Then Camorak said There are many things to be planned and counsels to
be taken and provender to be gathered. Upon what day shall we start? And
all the warriors answering shouted Now. And Camorak smiled thereat for
he had but tried them. Down then from the walls they took their weapons
Sikorix Kelleron Aslof Wole of the Axe; Huhenoth Peace-breaker;
Wolwuf Father of War; Tarion Lurth of the Warcry and many another.
Little then dreamed the spiders that sat in that ringing hall of the
unmolested leisure they were soon to enjoy.

When they were armed they all formed up and marched out of the hall and
Arleon strode before them singing of Carcassonne.

But the talk of the Weald arose and went back well fed to byres. They had
no need of wars or of rare perils. They were ever at war with hunger. A
long drought or hard winter were to them pitched battles; if the wolves
entered a sheep-fold it was like the loss of a fortress a thunder-storm
on the harvest was like an ambuscade. Well-fed they went back slowly to
their byres being at truce with hunger; and the night filled with stars.

And black against the starry sky appeared the round helms of the warriors
as they passed the tops of the ridges but in the valleys they sparkled
now and then as the starlight flashed on steel.

They followed behind Arleon going south whence rumours had always come of
Carcassonne: so they marched in the starlight and he before them singing.

When they had marched so far that they heard no sound from Arn and even
inaudible were her swinging bells when candles burning late far up in
towers no longer sent them their disconsolate welcome; in the midst of the
pleasant night that lulls the rural spaces weariness came upon Arleon and
his inspiration failed. It failed slowly. Gradually he grew less sure of
the way to Carcassonne. Awhile he stopped to think and remembered the way
again; but his clear certainty was gone and in its place were efforts in
his mind to recall old prophecies and shepherd's songs that told of the
marvelous city. Then as he said over carefully to himself a song that a
wanderer had learnt from a goatherd's boy far up the lower slope of
ultimate southern mountains fatigue came down upon his toiling mind like
snow on the winding ways of a city noisy by night stilling all.

He stood and the warriors closed up to him. For long they had passed by
great oaks standing solitary here and there like giants taking huge
breaths of the night air before doing some furious deed; now they had come
to the verge of a black forest; the tree-trunks stood like those great
columns in an Egyptian hall whence God in an older mood received the
praise of men; the top of it sloped the way of an ancient wind. Here they
all halted and lighted a fire of branches striking sparks from flint into
a heap of bracken. They eased them of their armour and sat round the
fire and Camorak stood up there and addressed them and Camorak said: We
go to war with Fate who has doomed that I shall not come to Carcassonne.
And if we turn aside but one of the dooms of Fate then the whole future
of the world is ours and the future that Fate has ordered is like the dry
course of an averted river. But if such men as we such resolute
conquerors cannot prevent one doom that Fate has planned then is the
race of man enslaved for ever to do its petty and allotted task.

Then they all drew their swords and waved them high in the firelight and
declared war on Fate.

Nothing in the somber forest stirred or made any sound.

Tired men do not dream of war. When morning came over the gleaming fields
a company that had set out from Arn discovered the discovered the
camping-place of the warriors and brought pavilions and provender. And
the warriors feasted and the birds in the forest sang and the
inspiration of Arleon awoke.

Then they rose and following Arleon entered the forest and marched away
to the South. And many a woman of Arn sent her thoughts with them as they
played alone some old monotonous tune but their own thoughts were far
before them skimming over the bath through whose deeps the river tumbles
in marble Carcassonne.

When butterflies were dancing on the air and the sun neared the zenith
pavilions were pitched and all the warriors rested; and then they feasted
again and then played knightly games and late in the afternoon marched
on once more singing of Carcassonne.

And night came down with its mystery on the forest and gave their
demoniac look again to the trees and rolled up out of misty hollows a
huge and yellow moon.

And the men of Arn lit fires and sudden shadows arose and leaped
fantastically away. And the night-wind blew arising like a ghost and
passed between the tree trunks and slipped down shimmering glades and
waked the prowling beasts still dreaming of day and drifted nocturnal
birds afield to menace timorous things and beat the roses of the
befriending night and wafted to the ears of wandering men the sound of a
maiden's song and gave a glamour to the lutanist's tune played in his
loneliness on distant hills; and the deep eyes of moths glowed like a
galleon's lamps and they spread their wings and sailed their familiar
sea. Upon this night-wind also the dreams of Camorak's men floated to
Carcassonne.

All the next morning they marched and all the evening and knew they were
nearing now the deeps of the forest. And the citizens of Arn kept close
together and close behind the warriors. For the deeps of the forest were
all unknown to travellers but not unknown to those tales of fear that men
tell at evening to their friends in the comfort and the safety of their
hearths. Then night appeared and an enormous moon. And the men of Camorak
slept. Sometimes they woke and went to sleep again; and those that stayed
awake for long and listened heard heavy two-footed creatures pad through
the night on paws.

As soon as it was light the unarmed men of Arn began to slip away and
went back by bands through the forest. When darkness came they did not
stop to sleep but continued their flight straight on until they came to
Arn and added there by the tales they told to the terror of the forest.

But the warriors feasted and afterwards Arleon rose and played his harp
and led them on again; and a few faithful servants stayed with them still.
And they marched all day through a gloom that was as old as night but
Arleon's inspiration burned in his mind like a star. And he led them till
the birds began to drop into the treetops and it was evening and they all
encamped. They had only one pavilion left to them now and near it they
lit a fire and Camorak posted a sentry with drawn sword just beyond the
glow of the firelight. Some of the warriors slept in the pavilion and
others round about it.

When dawn came something terrible had killed and eaten the sentry. But the
splendour of the rumours of Carcassonne and Fate's decree that they should
never come there and the inspiration of Arleon and his harp all urged
the warriors on; and they marched deeper and deeper all day into the
forest.

Once they saw a dragon that had caught a bear and was playing with it
letting it run a little way and overtaking it with a paw.

They came at last to a clear space in the forest just before nightfall. An
odour of flowers arose from it like a mist and every drop of dew
interpreted heaven unto itself.

It was the hour when twilight kisses Earth.

It was the hour when a meaning comes into senseless things and trees
out-majesty the pomp of monarchs and the timid creatures steal abroad to
feed and as yet the beasts of prey harmlessly dream and Earth utters a
sigh and it is night.

In the midst of the wide clearing Camorak's warriors camped and rejoiced
to see stars again appearing one by one.

That night they ate the last of their provisions and slept unmolested by
the prowling things that haunt the gloom of the forest.

On the next day some of the warriors hunted stags and others lay in
rushes by a neighbouring lake and shot arrows at water-fowl. One stag was
killed and some geese and several teal.

Here the adventurers stayed breathing the pure wild air that cities know
not; by day they hunted and lit fires by night and sang and feasted and
forgot Carcassonne. The terrible denizens of the gloom never molested
them venison was plentiful and all manner of water-fowl: they loved the
chase by day and by night their favourite songs. Thus day after day went
by thus week after week. Time flung over this encampment a handful of
moons the gold and silver moons that waste the year away; Autumn and
Winter passed and Spring appeared; and still the warriors hunted and
feasted there.

One night of the springtide they were feasting about a fire and telling
tales of the chase and the soft moths came out of the dark and flaunted
their colours in the firelight and went out grey into the dark again; and
the night wind was cool upon the warriors' necks and the camp-fire was
warm in their faces and a silence had settled among them after some song
and Arleon all at once rose suddenly up remembering Carcassonne. And his
hand swept over the strings of his harp awaking the deeper chords like
the sound of a nimble people dancing their steps on bronze and the music
rolled away into the night's own silence and the voice of Arleon rose:

When there is blood in the bath she knows there is war in the mountains
and longs for the battle-shout of kingly men.

And suddenly all shouted Carcassonne! And at that word their idleness
was gone as a dream is gone from a dreamer waked with a shout. And soon
the great march began that faltered no more nor wavered. Unchecked by
battles undaunted in lonesome spaces ever unwearied by the vulturous
years the warriors of Camorak held on; and Arleon's inspiration led them
still. They cleft with the music of Arleon's harp the gloom of ancient
silences; they went singing into battles with terrible wild men and came
out singing but with fewer voices; they came to villages in valleys full
of the music of bells or saw the lights at dusk of cottages sheltering
others.

They became a proverb for wandering and a legend arose of strange
disconsolate men. Folks spoke of them at nightfall when the fire was warm
and rain slipped down the eaves; and when the wind was high small children
feared the Men Who Would Not Rest were going clattering past. Strange
tales were told of men in old grey armour moving at twilight along the
tops of the hills and never asking shelter; and mothers told their boys
who grew impatient of home that the grey wanderers were once so impatient
and were now hopeless of rest and were driven along with the rain
whenever the wind was angry.

But the wanderers were cheered in their wandering by the hope of coming to
Carcassonne and later on by anger against Fate and at last they marched
on still because it seemed better to march on than to think.

For many years they had wandered and had fought with many tribes; often
they gathered legends in villages and listened to idle singers singing
songs; and all the rumours of Carcassonne still came from the South.

And then one day they came to a hilly land with a legend in it that only
three valleys away a man might see on clear days Carcassonne. Tired
though they were and few and worn with the years which had all brought
them wars they pushed on instantly led still by Arleon's inspiration
which dwindled in his age though he made music with his old harp still.

All day they climbed down into the first valley and for two days ascended
and came to the Town That May Not Be Taken In War below the top of the
mountain and its gates were shut against them and there was no way
round. To left and right steep precipices stood for as far as eye could
see or legend tell of and the pass lay through the city. Therefore
Camorak drew up his remaining warriors in line of battle to wage their
last war and they stepped forward over the crisp bones of old unburied
armies.

No sentinel defied them in the gate no arrow flew from any tower of war.
One citizen climbed alone to the mountain's top and the rest hid
themselves in sheltered places.

Now in the top of the mountain was a deep bowl-like cavern in the rock
in which fires bubbled softly. But if any cast a boulder into the fires
as it was the custom for one of those citizens to do when enemies
approached them the mountain hurled up intermittent rocks for three days
and the rocks fell flaming all over the town and all round about it. And
just as Camorak's men began to batter the gate they heard a crash on the
mountain and a great rock fell beyond them and rolled into the valley.
The next two fell in front of them on the iron roofs of the town. Just as
they entered the town a rock found them crowded in a narrow street and
shattered two of them. The mountain smoked and panted; with every pant a
rock plunged into the streets or bounced along the heavy iron roof and
the smoke went slowly up and up and up.

When they had come through the long town's empty streets to the locked
gate at the end only fifteen were left. When they had broken down the
gate there were only ten alive. Three more were killed as they went up the
slope and two as they passed near the terrible cavern. Fate let the rest
go some way down the mountain upon the other side and then took three of
them. Camorak and Arleon alone were left alive. And night came down on the
valley to which they had come and was lit by flashes from the fatal
mountain; and the two mourned for their comrades all night long.

But when the morning came they remembered their war with Fate and their
old resolve to come to Carcassonne and the voice of Arleon rose in a
quavering song and snatches of music from his old harp and he stood up
and marched with his face southwards as he had done for years and behind
him Camorak went. And when at last they climbed from the third valley and
stood on the hill's summit in the golden sunlight of evening their aged
eyes saw only miles of forest and the birds going to roost.

Their beards were white and they had travelled very far and hard; it was
the time with them when a man rests from labours and dreams in light sleep
of the years that were and not of the years to come.

Long they looked southwards; and the sun set over remoter forests and
glow-worms lit their lamps and the inspiration of Arleon rose and flew
away for ever to gladden perhaps the dreams of younger men.

And Arleon said: My King I know no longer the way to Carcassonne.

And Camorak smiled as the aged smile with little cause for mirth and
said: The years are going by us like huge birds whom Doom and Destiny
and the schemes of God have frightened up out of some old grey marsh. And
it may well be that against these no warrior may avail and that Fate has
conquered us and that our quest has failed.

And after this they were silent.

Then they drew their swords and side by side went down into the forest
still seeking Carcassonne.

I think they got not far; for there were deadly marshes in that forest
and gloom that outlasted the nights and fearful beasts accustomed to its
ways. Neither is there any legend either in verse or among the songs of
the people of the fields of any having come to Carcassonne.




IN ZACCARATH


Come said the King in sacred Zaccarath and let our prophets prophesy
before us.

A far-seen jewel of light was the holy palace a wonder to the nomads on
the plains.

There was the King with all his underlords and the lesser kings that did
him vassalage and there were all his queens with all their jewels upon
them.

Who shall tell of the splendour in which they sat; of the thousand lights
and the answering emeralds; of the dangerous beauty of that hoard of
queens or the flash of their laden necks?

There was a necklace there of rose-pink pearls beyond the art of the
dreamer to imagine. Who shall tell of the amethyst chandeliers where
torches soaked in rare Bhyrinian oils burned and gave off a scent of
blethany?

(This herb marvellous which growing near the summit of Mount Zaumnos
scents all the Zaumnian range and is smelt far out on the Kepuscran
plains and even when the wind is from the mountains in the streets of
the city of Ognoth. At night it closes its petals and is heard to breathe
and its breath is a swift poison. This it does even by day if the snows
are disturbed about it. No plant of this has ever been captured alive by a
hunter.)

Enough to say that when the dawn came up it appeared by contrast pallid
and unlovely and stripped bare of all its glory so that it hid itself
with rolling clouds.

Come said the King let our prophets prophesy.

Then the heralds stepped through the ranks of the King's silk-clad
warriors who lay oiled and scented upon velvet cloaks with a pleasant
breeze among them caused by the fans of slaves; even their casting-spears
were set with jewels; through their ranks the heralds went with mincing
steps and came to the prophets clad in brown and black and one of them
they brought and set him before the King. And the King looked at him and
said Prophesy unto us.

And the prophet lifted his head so that his beard came clear from his
brown cloak and the fans of the slaves that fanned the warriors wafted
the tip of it a little awry. And he spake to the King and spake thus:

Woe unto thee King and woe unto Zaccarath. Woe unto thee and woe unto
thy women for your fall shall be sore and soon. Already in Heaven the
gods shun thy god: they know his doom and what is written of him: he sees
oblivion before him like a mist. Thou hast aroused the hate of the
mountaineers. They hate thee all along the crags of Droom. The evilness of
thy days shall bring down the Zeedians on thee as the suns of springtide
bring the avalanche down. They shall do unto Zaccarath as the avalanche
doth unto the hamlets of the valley. When the queens chattered or
tittered among themselves he merely raised his voice and still spake on:
Woe to these walls and the carven things upon them. The hunter shall know
the camping-places of the nomads by the marks of the camp-fires on the
plain but he shall not know the place of Zaccarath.

A few of the recumbent warriors turned their heads to glance at the
prophet when he ceased. Far overhead the echoes of his voice hummed on
awhile among the cedarn rafters.

Is he not splendid? said the King. And many of that assembly beat with
their palms upon the polished floor in token of applause. Then the prophet
was conducted back to his place at the far end of that mighty hall and
for a while musicians played on marvellous curved horns while drums
throbbed behind them hidden in a recess. The musicians were sitting
crosslegged on the floor all blowing their huge horns in the brilliant
torchlight but as the drums throbbed louder in the dark they arose and
moved slowly nearer to the King. Louder and louder drummed the drums in
the dark and nearer and nearer moved the men with the horns so that
their music should not be drowned by the drums before it reached the King.

A marvellous scene it was when the tempestuous horns were halted before
the King and the drums in the dark were like the thunder of God; and the
queens were nodding their heads in time to the music with their diadems
flashing like heavens of falling stars; and the warriors lifted their
heads and shook as they lifted them the plumes of those golden birds
which hunters wait for by the Liddian lakes in a whole lifetime killing
scarcely six to make the crests that the warriors wore when they feasted
in Zaccarath. Then the King shouted and the warriors sang--almost they
remembered then old battle-chants. And as they sang the sound of the
drums dwindled and the musicians walked away backwards and the drumming
became fainter and fainter as they walked and altogether ceased and they
blew no more on their fantastic horns. Then the assemblage beat on the
floor with their palms. And afterwards the queens besought the King to
send for another prophet. And the heralds brought a singer and placed him
before the King; and the singer was a young man with a harp. And he swept
the strings of it and when there was silence he sang of the iniquity of
the King. And he foretold the onrush of the Zeedians and the fall and the
forgetting of Zaccarath and the coming again of the desert to its own
and the playing about of little lion cubs where the courts of the palace
had stood.

Of what is he singing? said a queen to a queen.

He is singing of everlasting Zaccarath.

As the singer ceased the assemblage beat listlessly on the floor and the
King nodded to him and he departed.

When all the prophets had prophesied to them and all the singers sung
that royal company arose and went to other chambers leaving the hall of
festival to the pale and lonely dawn. And alone were left the lion-headed
gods that were carven out of the walls; silent they stood and their rocky
arms were folded. And shadows over their faces moved like curious thoughts
as the torches flickered and the dull dawn crossed the fields. And the
colours began to change in the chandeliers.

When the last lutanist fell asleep the birds began to sing.

Never was greater splendour or a more famous hall. When the queens went
away through the curtained door with all their diadems it was as though
the stars should arise in their stations and troop together to the West at
sunrise.

And only the other day I found a stone that had undoubtedly been a part of
Zaccarath it was three inches long and an inch broad; I saw the edge of
it uncovered by the sand. I believe that only three other pieces have been
found like it.




THE FIELD


When one has seen Spring's blossom fall in London and Summer appear and
ripen and decay as it does early in cities and one is in London still
then at some moment or another the country places lift their flowery
heads and call to one with an urgent masterful clearness upland behind
upland in the twilight like to some heavenly choir arising rank on rank to
call a drunkard from his gambling-hell. No volume of traffic can drown the
sound of it no lure of London can weaken its appeal. Having heard it
one's fancy is gone and evermore departed to some coloured pebble agleam
in a rural brook and all that London can offer is swept from one's mind
like some suddenly smitten metropolitan Goliath.

The call is from afar both in leagues and years for the hills that call
one are the hills that were and their voices are the voices of long ago
when the elf-kings still had horns.

I see them now those hills of my infancy (for it is they that call) with
their faces upturned to the purple twilight and the faint diaphanous
figures of the fairies peering out from under the bracken to see if
evening is come. I do not see upon their regal summits those desirable
mansions and highly desirable residences which have lately been built
for gentlemen who would exchange customers for tenants.

When the hills called I used to go to them by road riding a bicycle. If
you go by train you miss the gradual approach you do not cast off London
like an old forgiven sin nor pass by little villages on the way that must
have some rumour of the hills; nor wondering if they are still the same
come at last upon the edge of their far-spread robes and so on to their
feet and see far off their holy welcoming faces. In the train you see
them suddenly round a curve and there they all are sitting in the sun.

I imagine that as one penetrated out from some enormous forest of the
tropics the wild beasts would become fewer the gloom would lighten and
the horror of the place would slowly lift. Yet as one emerges nearer to
the edge of London and nearer to the beautiful influence of the hills
the houses become uglier the streets viler the gloom deepens the errors
of civilisation stand bare to the scorn of the fields.

Where ugliness reaches the height of its luxuriance in the dense misery
of the place where one imagines the builder saying Here I culminate.
Let us give thanks to Satan there is a bridge of yellow brick and
through it as through some gate of filigree silver opening on fairyland
one passes into the country.

To left and right as far as one can see stretches that monstrous city;
before one are the fields like an old old song.

There is a field there that is full of king-cups. A stream runs through
it and along the stream is a little wood of osiers. There I used often to
rest at the streams edge before my long journey to the hills.

There I used to forget London street by street. Sometimes I picked a
bunch of king-cups to show them to the hills.

I often came there. At first I noticed nothing about the field except its
beauty and its peacefulness.

But the second time that I came I thought there was something ominous
about the field.

Down there among the king-cups by the little shallow stream I felt that
something terrible might happen in just such a place.

I did not stay long there because I thought that too much time spent in
London had brought on these morbid fancies and I went on to the hills as
fast as I could.

I stayed for some days in the country air and when I came back I went to
the field again to enjoy that peaceful spot before entering London. But
there was still something ominous among the osiers.

A year elapsed before I went there again. I emerged from the shadow of
London into the gleaming sun; the bright green grass and the king-cups
were flaming in the light and the little stream was singing a happy song.
But the moment I stepped into the field my old uneasiness returned and
worse than before. It was as though the shadow was brooding there of some
dreadful future thing and a year had brought it nearer.

I reasoned that the exertion of bicycling might be bad for one and that
the moment one rested this uneasiness might result.

A little later I came back past the field by night and the song of the
stream in the hush attracted me down to it. And there the fancy came to me
that it would be a terribly cold place to be in the starlight if for some
reason one was hurt and could not get away.

I knew a man who was minutely acquainted with the past history of that
locality and him I asked if anything historical had ever happened in that
field. When he pressed me for my reason in asking him this I said that
the field had seemed to me such a good place to hold a pageant in. But he
said that nothing of any interest had ever occurred there nothing at all.

So it was from the future that the field's terrible trouble came.

For three years off and on I made visits to the field and every time more
clearly it boded evil things and my uneasiness grew more acute every time
that I was lured to go and rest among the cool green grass under the
beautiful osiers. Once to distract my thoughts I tried to gauge how fast
the stream was trickling but I found myself wondering if it flowed faster
than blood.

I felt that it would be a terrible place to go mad in one would hear
voices.

At last I went to a poet whom I knew and woke him from huge dreams and
put before him the whole case of the field. He had not been out of London
all that year and he promised to come with me and look at the field and
tell me what was going to happen there. It was late in July when we went.
The pavement the air the houses and the dirt had been all baked dry by
the summer the weary traffic dragged on and on and on and Sleep
spreading her wings soared up and floated from London and went to walk
beautifully in rural places.

When the poet saw the field he was delighted the flowers were out in
masses all along the stream he went down to the little wood rejoicing. By
the side of the stream he stood and seemed very sad. Once or twice he
looked up and down it mournfully then he bent and looked at the
king-cups first one and then another very closely and shaking his head.

For a long while he stood in silence and all my old uneasiness returned
and my bodings for the future.

And then I said What manner of field is it?

And he shook his head sorrowfully.

It is a battlefield he said.




THE DAY OF THE POLL


In the town by the sea it was the day of the poll and the poet regarded
it sadly when he woke and saw the light of it coming in at his window
between two small curtains of gauze. And the day of the poll was
beautifully bright; stray bird-songs came to the poet at the window; the
air was crisp and wintry but it was the blaze of sunlight that had
deceived the birds. He heard the sound of the sea that the moon led up the
shore dragging the months away over the pebbles and shingles and piling
them up with the years where the worn-out centuries lay; he saw the
majestic downs stand facing mightily south-wards; saw the smoke of the
town float up to their heavenly faces--column after column rose calmly
into the morning as house by house was waked by peering shafts of the
sunlight and lit its fires for the day; column by column went up toward
the serene downs' faces and failed before they came there and hung all
white over houses; and every one in the town was raving mad.

It was a strange thing that the poet did for he hired the largest motor
in the town and covered it with all the flags he could find and set out
to save an intelligence. And he presently found a man whose face was hot
who shouted that the time was not far distant when a candidate whom he
named would be returned at the head of the poll by a thumping majority.
And by him the poet stopped and offered him a seat in the motor that was
covered with flags. When the man saw the flags that were on the motor and
that it was the largest in the town he got in. He said that his vote
should be given for that fiscal system that had made us what we are in
order that the poor man's food should not be taxed to make the rich man
richer. Or else it was that he would give his vote for that system of
tariff reform which should unite us closer to our colonies with ties that
should long endure and give employment to all. But it was not to the
polling-booth that the motor went it passed it and left the town and came
by a small white winding road to the very top of the downs. There the poet
dismissed the car and let that wondering voter on to the grass and seated
himself on a rug. And for long the voter talked of those imperial
traditions that our forefathers had made for us and which he should uphold
with his vote or else it was of a people oppressed by a feudal system
that was out of date and effete and that should be ended or mended. But
the poet pointed out to him small distant wandering ships on the sunlit
strip of sea and the birds far down below them and the houses below the
birds with the little columns of smoke that could not find the downs.

And at first the voter cried for his polling-booth like a child; but after
a while he grew calmer save when faint bursts of cheering came twittering
up to the downs when the voter would cry out bitterly against the
misgovernment of the Radical party or else it was--I forget what the poet
told me--he extolled its splendid record.

See said the poet these ancient beautiful things the downs and the
old-time houses and the morning and the grey sea in the sunlight going
mumbling round the world. And this is the place they have chosen to go man
in!

And standing there with all broad England behind him rolling northward
down after down and before him the glittering sea too far for the sound
of the roar of it there seemed to the voter to grow less important the
questions that troubled the town. Yet he was still angry.

Why did you bring me here? he said again.

Because I grew lonely said the poet when all the town went mad.

Then he pointed out to the voter some old bent thorns and showed him the
way that a wind had blown for a million years coming up at dawn from the
sea; and he told him of the storms that visit the ships and their names
and whence they come and the currents they drive afield and the way that
the swallows go. And he spoke of the down where they sat when the summer
came and the flowers that were not yet and the different butterflies
and about the bats and the swifts and the thoughts in the heart of man.
He spoke of the aged windmill that stood on the down and of how to
children it seemed a strange old man who was only dead by day. And as he
spoke and as the sea-wind blew on that high and lonely place there began
to slip away from the voter's mind meaningless phrases that had crowded it
long--thumping majority--victory in the fight--terminological
inexactitudes--and the smell of paraffin lamps dangling in heated
schoolrooms and quotations taken from ancient speeches because the words
were long. They fell away though slowly and slowly the voter saw a wider
world and the wonder of the sea. And the afternoon wore on and the winter
evening came and the night fell and all black grew the sea and about
the time that the stars come blinking out to look upon our littleness the
polling-booth closed in the town.

When they got back the turmoil was on the wane in the streets; night hid
the glare of the posters; and the tide finding the noise abated and being
at the flow told an old tale that he had learned in his youth about the
deeps of the sea the same which he had told to coastwise ships that
brought it to Babylon by the way of Euphrates before the doom of Troy.

I blame my friend the poet however lonely he was for preventing this man
from registering his vote (the duty of every citizen); but perhaps it
matters less as it was a foregone conclusion because the losing
candidate either through poverty or sheer madness had neglected to
subscribe to a single football club.




THE UNHAPPY BODY


Why do you not dance with us and rejoice with us? they said to a certain
body. And then that body made the confession of its trouble. It said: I
am united with a fierce and violent soul that is altogether tyrannous and
will not let me rest and he drags me away from the dances of my kin to
make me toil at his detestable work; and he will not let me do the little
things that would give pleasure to the folk I love but only cares to
please posterity when he has done with me and left me to the worms; and
all the while he makes absurd demands of affection from those that are
near to me and is too proud even to notice any less than he demands so
that those that should be kind to me all hate me. And the unhappy body
burst into tears.

And they said: No sensible body cares for its soul. A soul is a little
thing and should not rule a body. You should drink and smoke more till he
ceases to trouble you. But the body only wept and said Mine is a
fearful soul. I have driven him away for a little while with drink. But he
will soon come back. Oh he will soon come back!

And the body went to bed hoping to rest for it was drowsy with drink. But
just as sleep was near it it looked up and there was its soul sitting on
the windowsill a misty blaze of light and looking into the river.

Come said the tyrannous soul and look into the street.

I have need of sleep said the body.

But the street is a beautiful thing the soul said vehemently; a
hundred of the people are dreaming there.

I am ill through want of rest the body said.

That does not matter the soul said to it. There are millions like you
in the earth and millions more to go there. The people's dreams are
wandering afield; they pass the seas and mountains of fary threading the
intricate passes led by their souls; they come to golden temples a-ring
with a thousand bells; they pass up steep streets lit by paper lanterns
where the doors are green and small; they know their way to witches'
chambers and castles of enchantment; they know the spell that brings them
to the causeway along the ivory mountains--on one side looking downward
they behold the fields of their youth and on the other lie the radiant
plains of the future. Arise and write down what the people dream.

What reward is there for me said the body if I write down what you
bid me?

There is no reward said the soul.

Then I shall sleep said the body.

And the soul began to hum an idle song sung by a young man in a fabulous
land as he passed a golden city (where fiery sentinels stood) and knew
that his wife was within it though as yet but a little child and knew by
prophecy that furious wars not yet arisen in far and unknown mountains
should roll above him with their dust and thirst before he ever came to
that city again--the young man sang it as he passed the gate and was now
dead with his wife a thousand years.

I cannot sleep for that abominable song the body cried to the soul.

Then do as you are commanded the soul replied. And wearily the body
took a pen again. Then the soul spoke merrily as he looked through the
window. There is a mountain lifting sheer above London part crystal and
part myst. Thither the dreamers go when the sound of the traffic has
fallen. At first they scarcely dream because of the roar of it but before
midnight it stops and turns and ebbs with all its wrecks. Then the
dreamers arise and scale the shimmering mountain and at its summit find
the galleons of dream. Thence some sail East some West some into the
Past and some into the Future for the galleons sail over the years as
well as over the spaces but mostly they head for the Past and the olden
harbours for thither the sighs of men are mostly turned and the
dream-ships go before them as the merchantmen before the continual
trade-winds go down the African coast. I see the galleons even now raise
anchor after anchor; the stars flash by them; they slip out of the night;
their prows go gleaming into the twilight of memory and night soon lies
far off a black cloud hanging low and faintly spangled with stars like
the harbour and shore of some low-lying land seen afar with its harbour
lights.

Dream after dream that soul related as he sat there by the window. He told
of tropical forests seen by unhappy men who could not escape from London
and never would--forests made suddenly wondrous by the song of some
passing bird flying to unknown eyries and singing an unknown song. He saw
the old men lightly dancing to the tune of elfin pipes--beautiful dances
with fantastic maidens--all night on moonlit imaginary mountains; he heard
far off the music of glittering Springs; he saw the fairness of blossoms
of apple and may thirty years fallen; he heard old voices--old tears came
glistening back; Romance sat cloaked and crowned upon southern hills and
the soul knew him.

One by one he told the dreams of all that slept in that street. Sometimes
he stopped to revile the body because it worked badly and slowly. Its
chill fingers wrote as fast as they could but the soul cared not for
that. And so the night wore on till the soul heard tinkling in Oriental
skies far footfalls of the morning.

See now said the soul the dawn that the dreamers dread. The sails of
light are paling on those unwreckable galleons; the mariners that steer
them slip back into fable and myth; that other sea the traffic is turning
now at its ebb and is about to hide its pallid wrecks and to come
swinging back with its tumult at the flow. Already the sunlight flashes
in the gulfs behind the east of the world; the gods have seen it from
their palace of twilight that the built above the sunrise; they warm their
hands at its glow as it streams through their gleaming arches before it
reaches the world; all the gods are there that have ever been and all the
gods that shall be; they sit there in the morning chanting and praising
Man.

I am numb and very cold for want of sleep said the body.

You shall have centuries of sleep said the soul but you must not
sleep now for I have seen deep meadows with purple flowers flaming tall
and strange above the brilliant grass and herds of pure white unicorns
that gambol there for joy and a river running by with a glittering
galleon on it all of gold that goes from an unknown inland to an unknown
isle of the sea to take a song from the King of Over-the-Hills to the
Queen of Far-Away.

I will sing that song to you and you shall write it down.

I have toiled for you for years the body said. Give me now but one
night's rest for I am exceeding weary.

Oh go and rest. I am tired of you. I am off said the soul.

And he arose and went we know not whither. But the body they laid in the
earth. And the next night at midnight the wraiths of the dead came
drifting from their tombs to felicitate that body.

You are free here you know they said to their new companion.

Now I can rest said the body.

"THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS

By Lewis Carroll


The Millennium Fulcrum Edition 1.7




CHAPTER I. Looking-Glass house

One thing was certain that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to do with
it:--it was the black kittens fault entirely. For the white kitten had
been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of
an hour (and bearing it pretty well considering); so you see that it
COULDNT have had any hand in the mischief.

The way Dinah washed her childrens faces was this: first she held the
poor thing down by its ear with one paw and then with the other paw she
rubbed its face all over the wrong way beginning at the nose: and
just now as I said she was hard at work on the white kitten which was
lying quite still and trying to purr--no doubt feeling that it was all
meant for its good.

But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon
and so while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great
arm-chair half talking to herself and half asleep the kitten had been
having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been
trying to wind up and had been rolling it up and down till it had all
come undone again; and there it was spread over the hearth-rug all
knots and tangles with the kitten running after its own tail in the
middle.

Oh you wicked little thing! cried Alice catching up the kitten and
giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.
Really Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You OUGHT
Dinah you know you ought! she added looking reproachfully at the old
cat and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage--and then she
scrambled back into the arm-chair taking the kitten and the worsted
with her and began winding up the ball again. But she didnt get on
very fast as she was talking all the time sometimes to the kitten and
sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee pretending to
watch the progress of the winding and now and then putting out one
paw and gently touching the ball as if it would be glad to help if it
might.

Do you know what to-morrow is Kitty? Alice began. Youd have guessed
if youd been up in the window with me--only Dinah was making you tidy
so you couldnt. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the
bonfire--and it wants plenty of sticks Kitty! Only it got so cold and
it snowed so they had to leave off. Never mind Kitty well go and
see the bonfire to-morrow. Here Alice wound two or three turns of the
worsted round the kittens neck just to see how it would look: this led
to a scramble in which the ball rolled down upon the floor and yards
and yards of it got unwound again.

Do you know I was so angry Kitty Alice went on as soon as they were
comfortably settled again when I saw all the mischief you had been
doing I was very nearly opening the window and putting you out into
the snow! And youd have deserved it you little mischievous darling!
What have you got to say for yourself? Now dont interrupt me! she
went on holding up one finger. Im going to tell you all your faults.
Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this
morning. Now you cant deny it Kitty: I heard you! Whats that you
say? (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) Her paw went into your
eye? Well thats YOUR fault for keeping your eyes open--if youd
shut them tight up it wouldnt have happened. Now dont make any more
excuses but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail
just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What you were
thirsty were you? How do you know she wasnt thirsty too? Now for
number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasnt
looking!

Thats three faults Kitty and youve not been punished for any of
them yet. You know Im saving up all your punishments for Wednesday
week--Suppose they had saved up all MY punishments! she went on
talking more to herself than the kitten. What WOULD they do at the end
of a year? I should be sent to prison I suppose when the day came.
Or--let me see--suppose each punishment was to be going without a
dinner: then when the miserable day came I should have to go without
fifty dinners at once! Well I shouldnt mind THAT much! Id far rather
go without them than eat them!

Do you hear the snow against the window-panes Kitty? How nice and soft
it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside.
I wonder if the snow LOVES the trees and fields that it kisses them so
gently? And then it covers them up snug you know with a white quilt;
and perhaps it says Go to sleep darlings till the summer comes
again. And when they wake up in the summer Kitty they dress
themselves all in green and dance about--whenever the wind blows--oh
thats very pretty! cried Alice dropping the ball of worsted to clap
her hands. And I do so WISH it was true! Im sure the woods look sleepy
in the autumn when the leaves are getting brown.

Kitty can you play chess? Now dont smile my dear Im asking it
seriously. Because when we were playing just now you watched just as
if you understood it: and when I said Check! you purred! Well it WAS
a nice check Kitty and really I might have won if it hadnt been for
that nasty Knight that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty dear
lets pretend-- And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice
used to say beginning with her favourite phrase Lets pretend. She
had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before--all
because Alice had begun with Lets pretend were kings and queens; and
her sister who liked being very exact had argued that they couldnt
because there were only two of them and Alice had been reduced at last
to say Well YOU can be one of them then and ILL be all the rest.
And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in
her ear Nurse! Do lets pretend that Im a hungry hyaena and youre a
bone.

But this is taking us away from Alices speech to the kitten. Lets
pretend that youre the Red Queen Kitty! Do you know I think if you
sat up and folded your arms youd look exactly like her. Now do try
theres a dear! And Alice got the Red Queen off the table and set it
up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however the thing
didnt succeed principally Alice said because the kitten wouldnt
fold its arms properly. So to punish it she held it up to the
Looking-glass that it might see how sulky it was--and if youre not
good directly she added Ill put you through into Looking-glass
House. How would you like THAT?

Now if youll only attend Kitty and not talk so much Ill tell you
all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First theres the room you can
see through the glass--thats just the same as our drawing room only
the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a
chair--all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could
see THAT bit! I want so much to know whether theyve a fire in the
winter: you never CAN tell you know unless our fire smokes and then
smoke comes up in that room too--but that may be only pretence just to
make it look as if they had a fire. Well then the books are something
like our books only the words go the wrong way; I know that because
Ive held up one of our books to the glass and then they hold up one in
the other room.

How would you like to live in Looking-glass House Kitty? I wonder if
theyd give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isnt good
to drink--But oh Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a
little PEEP of the passage in Looking-glass House if you leave the door
of our drawing-room wide open: and its very like our passage as far
as you can see only you know it may be quite different on beyond.
Oh Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into
Looking-glass House! Im sure its got oh! such beautiful things in it!
Lets pretend theres a way of getting through into it somehow Kitty.
Lets pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze so that we can get
through. Why its turning into a sort of mist now I declare! Itll be
easy enough to get through-- She was up on the chimney-piece while she
said this though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly
the glass WAS beginning to melt away just like a bright silvery mist.

In another moment Alice was through the glass and had jumped lightly
down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was
to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace and she was quite
pleased to find that there was a real one blazing away as brightly as
the one she had left behind. So I shall be as warm here as I was in the
old room thought Alice: warmer in fact because therell be no one
here to scold me away from the fire. Oh what fun itll be when they
see me through the glass in here and cant get at me!

Then she began looking about and noticed that what could be seen from
the old room was quite common and uninteresting but that all the rest
was as different as possible. For instance the pictures on the
wall next the fire seemed to be all alive and the very clock on
the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the
Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man and grinned at her.

They dont keep this room so tidy as the other Alice thought to
herself as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among
the cinders: but in another moment with a little Oh! of surprise she
was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking
about two and two!

Here are the Red King and the Red Queen Alice said (in a whisper for
fear of frightening them) and there are the White King and the White
Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel--and here are two castles
walking arm in arm--I dont think they can hear me she went on as she
put her head closer down and Im nearly sure they cant see me. I feel
somehow as if I were invisible--

Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and
begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would
happen next.

It is the voice of my child! the White Queen cried out as she rushed
past the King so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders.
My precious Lily! My imperial kitten! and she began scrambling wildly
up the side of the fender.

Imperial fiddlestick! said the King rubbing his nose which had been
hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a LITTLE annoyed with the Queen
for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.

Alice was very anxious to be of use and as the poor little Lily was
nearly screaming herself into a fit she hastily picked up the Queen and
set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.

The Queen gasped and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had
quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing
but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her
breath a little she called out to the White King who was sitting
sulkily among the ashes Mind the volcano!

What volcano? said the King looking up anxiously into the fire as if
he thought that was the most likely place to find one.

Blew--me--up panted the Queen who was still a little out of breath.
Mind you come up--the regular way--dont get blown up!

Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar
till at last she said Why youll be hours and hours getting to the
table at that rate. Id far better help you hadnt I? But the King
took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither
hear her nor see her.

So Alice picked him up very gently and lifted him across more slowly
than she had lifted the Queen that she mightnt take his breath away:
but before she put him on the table she thought she might as well dust
him a little he was so covered with ashes.

She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face
as the King made when he found himself held in the air by an invisible
hand and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out but
his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger and rounder
and rounder till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let
him drop upon the floor.

Oh! PLEASE dont make such faces my dear! she cried out quite
forgetting that the King couldnt hear her. You make me laugh so that
I can hardly hold you! And dont keep your mouth so wide open! All the
ashes will get into it--there now I think youre tidy enough! she
added as she smoothed his hair and set him upon the table near the
Queen.

The King immediately fell flat on his back and lay perfectly still: and
Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done and went round the room
to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However she could
find nothing but a bottle of ink and when she got back with it she
found he had recovered and he and the Queen were talking together in a
frightened whisper--so low that Alice could hardly hear what they said.

The King was saying I assure you my dear I turned cold to the very
ends of my whiskers!

To which the Queen replied You havent got any whiskers.

The horror of that moment the King went on I shall never NEVER
forget!

You will though the Queen said if you dont make a memorandum of
it.

Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous
memorandum-book out of his pocket and began writing. A sudden thought
struck her and she took hold of the end of the pencil which came some
way over his shoulder and began writing for him.

The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy and struggled with the pencil
for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him
and at last he panted out My dear! I really MUST get a thinner pencil.
I cant manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I
dont intend--

What manner of things? said the Queen looking over the book (in which
Alice had put THE WHITE KNIGHT IS SLIDING DOWN THE POKER. HE BALANCES
VERY BADLY) Thats not a memorandum of YOUR feelings!

There was a book lying near Alice on the table and while she sat
watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him
and had the ink all ready to throw over him in case he fainted again)
she turned over the leaves to find some part that she could read
--for its all in some language I dont know she said to herself.

It was like this.


             YKCOWREBBAJ

     sevot yhtils eht dnagillirb sawT
      ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg diD
        sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA
       .ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA


She puzzled over this for some time but at last a bright thought struck
her. Why its a Looking-glass book of course! And if I hold it up to
a glass the words will all go the right way again.

This was the poem that Alice read.


             JABBERWOCKY

     Twas brillig and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

     Beware the Jabberwock my son!
      The jaws that bite the claws that catch!
     Beware the Jubjub bird and shun
      The frumious Bandersnatch!

     He took his vorpal sword in hand:
      Long time the manxome foe he sought--
     So rested he by the Tumtum tree
      And stood awhile in thought.

     And as in uffish thought he stood
      The Jabberwock with eyes of flame
     Came whiffling through the tulgey wood
      And burbled as it came!

     One two! One two! And through and through
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
     He left it dead and with its head
      He went galumphing back.

     And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
      Come to my arms my beamish boy!
     O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!
      He chortled in his joy.

     Twas brillig and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves
      And the mome raths outgrabe.


It seems very pretty she said when she had finished it but its
RATHER hard to understand! (You see she didnt like to confess even
to herself that she couldnt make it out at all.) Somehow it seems
to fill my head with ideas--only I dont exactly know what they are!
However SOMEBODY killed SOMETHING: thats clear at any rate--

But oh! thought Alice suddenly jumping up if I dont make haste I
shall have to go back through the Looking-glass before Ive seen what
the rest of the house is like! Lets have a look at the garden first!
She was out of the room in a moment and ran down stairs--or at least
it wasnt exactly running but a new invention of hers for getting down
stairs quickly and easily as Alice said to herself. She just kept the
tips of her fingers on the hand-rail and floated gently down without
even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the
hall and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way if
she hadnt caught hold of the door-post. She was getting a little giddy
with so much floating in the air and was rather glad to find herself
walking again in the natural way.




CHAPTER II. The Garden of Live Flowers

I should see the garden far better said Alice to herself if I could
get to the top of that hill: and heres a path that leads straight to
it--at least no it doesnt do that-- (after going a few yards along
the path and turning several sharp corners) but I suppose it will
at last. But how curiously it twists! Its more like a corkscrew than a
path! Well THIS turn goes to the hill I suppose--no it doesnt! This
goes straight back to the house! Well then Ill try it the other way.

And so she did: wandering up and down and trying turn after turn but
always coming back to the house do what she would. Indeed once when
she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual she ran against it
before she could stop herself.

Its no use talking about it Alice said looking up at the house and
pretending it was arguing with her. Im NOT going in again yet. I know
I should have to get through the Looking-glass again--back into the old
room--and thered be an end of all my adventures!

So resolutely turning her back upon the house she set out once more
down the path determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill.
For a few minutes all went on well and she was just saying I really
SHALL do it this time-- when the path gave a sudden twist and shook
itself (as she described it afterwards) and the next moment she found
herself actually walking in at the door.

Oh its too bad! she cried. I never saw such a house for getting in
the way! Never!

However there was the hill full in sight so there was nothing to be
done but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed with a
border of daisies and a willow-tree growing in the middle.

O Tiger-lily said Alice addressing herself to one that was waving
gracefully about in the wind I WISH you could talk!

We CAN talk said the Tiger-lily: when theres anybody worth talking
to.

Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite
seemed to take her breath away. At length as the Tiger-lily only went
on waving about she spoke again in a timid voice--almost in a whisper.
And can ALL the flowers talk?

As well as YOU can said the Tiger-lily. And a great deal louder.

It isnt manners for us to begin you know said the Rose and I
really was wondering when youd speak! Said I to myself Her face has
got SOME sense in it though its not a clever one! Still youre the
right colour and that goes a long way.

I dont care about the colour the Tiger-lily remarked. If only her
petals curled up a little more shed be all right.

Alice didnt like being criticised so she began asking questions.
Arent you sometimes frightened at being planted out here with nobody
to take care of you?

Theres the tree in the middle said the Rose: what else is it good
for?

But what could it do if any danger came? Alice asked.

It says Bough-wough! cried a Daisy: thats why its branches are
called boughs!

Didnt you know THAT? cried another Daisy and here they all began
shouting together till the air seemed quite full of little shrill
voices. Silence every one of you! cried the Tiger-lily waving itself
passionately from side to side and trembling with excitement. They
know I cant get at them! it panted bending its quivering head towards
Alice or they wouldnt dare to do it!

Never mind! Alice said in a soothing tone and stooping down to the
daisies who were just beginning again she whispered If you dont
hold your tongues Ill pick you!

There was silence in a moment and several of the pink daisies turned
white.

Thats right! said the Tiger-lily. The daisies are worst of all. When
one speaks they all begin together and its enough to make one wither
to hear the way they go on!

How is it you can all talk so nicely? Alice said hoping to get it
into a better temper by a compliment. Ive been in many gardens before
but none of the flowers could talk.

Put your hand down and feel the ground said the Tiger-lily. Then
youll know why.

Alice did so. Its very hard she said but I dont see what that has
to do with it.

In most gardens the Tiger-lily said they make the beds too soft--so
that the flowers are always asleep.

This sounded a very good reason and Alice was quite pleased to know it.
I never thought of that before! she said.

Its MY opinion that you never think AT ALL the Rose said in a rather
severe tone.

I never saw anybody that looked stupider a Violet said so suddenly
that Alice quite jumped; for it hadnt spoken before.

Hold YOUR tongue! cried the Tiger-lily. As if YOU ever saw anybody!
You keep your head under the leaves and snore away there till you know
no more whats going on in the world than if you were a bud!

Are there any more people in the garden besides me? Alice said not
choosing to notice the Roses last remark.

Theres one other flower in the garden that can move about like you
said the Rose. I wonder how you do it-- (Youre always wondering
said the Tiger-lily) but shes more bushy than you are.

Is she like me? Alice asked eagerly for the thought crossed her mind
Theres another little girl in the garden somewhere!

Well she has the same awkward shape as you the Rose said but shes
redder--and her petals are shorter I think.

Her petals are done up close almost like a dahlia the Tiger-lily
interrupted: not tumbled about anyhow like yours.

But thats not YOUR fault the Rose added kindly: youre beginning
to fade you know--and then one cant help ones petals getting a little
untidy.

Alice didnt like this idea at all: so to change the subject she asked
Does she ever come out here?

I daresay youll see her soon said the Rose. Shes one of the thorny
kind.

Where does she wear the thorns? Alice asked with some curiosity.

Why all round her head of course the Rose replied. I was wondering
YOU hadnt got some too. I thought it was the regular rule.

Shes coming! cried the Larkspur. I hear her footstep thump thump
thump along the gravel-walk!

Alice looked round eagerly and found that it was the Red Queen. Shes
grown a good deal! was her first remark. She had indeed: when Alice
first found her in the ashes she had been only three inches high--and
here she was half a head taller than Alice herself!

Its the fresh air that does it said the Rose: wonderfully fine air
it is out here.

I think Ill go and meet her said Alice for though the flowers were
interesting enough she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk
with a real Queen.

You cant possibly do that said the Rose: _I_ should advise you to
walk the other way.

This sounded nonsense to Alice so she said nothing but set off at
once towards the Red Queen. To her surprise she lost sight of her in a
moment and found herself walking in at the front-door again.

A little provoked she drew back and after looking everywhere for the
queen (whom she spied out at last a long way off) she thought she
would try the plan this time of walking in the opposite direction.

It succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minute before she
found herself face to face with the Red Queen and full in sight of the
hill she had been so long aiming at.

Where do you come from? said the Red Queen. And where are you going?
Look up speak nicely and dont twiddle your fingers all the time.

Alice attended to all these directions and explained as well as she
could that she had lost her way.

I dont know what you mean by YOUR way said the Queen: all the ways
about here belong to ME--but why did you come out here at all? she
added in a kinder tone. Curtsey while youre thinking what to say it
saves time.

Alice wondered a little at this but she was too much in awe of the
Queen to disbelieve it. Ill try it when I go home she thought to
herself the next time Im a little late for dinner.

Its time for you to answer now the Queen said looking at her watch:
open your mouth a LITTLE wider when you speak and always say your
Majesty.

I only wanted to see what the garden was like your Majesty--

Thats right said the Queen patting her on the head which Alice
didnt like at all though when you say garden--IVE seen gardens
compared with which this would be a wilderness.

Alice didnt dare to argue the point but went on: --and I thought Id
try and find my way to the top of that hill--

When you say hill the Queen interrupted _I_ could show you hills
in comparison with which youd call that a valley.

No I shouldnt said Alice surprised into contradicting her at last:
a hill CANT be a valley you know. That would be nonsense--

The Red Queen shook her head You may call it nonsense if you like
she said but IVE heard nonsense compared with which that would be as
sensible as a dictionary!

Alice curtseyed again as she was afraid from the Queens tone that she
was a LITTLE offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to
the top of the little hill.

For some minutes Alice stood without speaking looking out in all
directions over the country--and a most curious country it was. There
were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side
to side and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number
of little green hedges that reached from brook to brook.

I declare its marked out just like a large chessboard! Alice said at
last. There ought to be some men moving about somewhere--and so there
are! She added in a tone of delight and her heart began to beat quick
with excitement as she went on. Its a great huge game of chess thats
being played--all over the world--if this IS the world at all you know.
Oh what fun it is! How I WISH I was one of them! I wouldnt mind being
a Pawn if only I might join--though of course I should LIKE to be a
Queen best.

She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this but her
companion only smiled pleasantly and said Thats easily managed. You
can be the White Queens Pawn if you like as Lilys too young to
play; and youre in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to
the Eighth Square youll be a Queen-- Just at this moment somehow or
other they began to run.

Alice never could quite make out in thinking it over afterwards how it
was that they began: all she remembers is that they were running hand
in hand and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep
up with her: and still the Queen kept crying Faster! Faster! but Alice
felt she COULD NOT go faster though she had not breath left to say so.

The most curious part of the thing was that the trees and the other
things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they
went they never seemed to pass anything. I wonder if all the things
move along with us? thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to
guess her thoughts for she cried Faster! Dont try to talk!

Not that Alice had any idea of doing THAT. She felt as if she would
never be able to talk again she was getting so much out of breath: and
still the Queen cried Faster! Faster! and dragged her along. Are we
nearly there? Alice managed to pant out at last.

Nearly there! the Queen repeated. Why we passed it ten minutes ago!
Faster! And they ran on for a time in silence with the wind whistling
in Alices ears and almost blowing her hair off her head she fancied.

Now! Now! cried the Queen. Faster! Faster! And they went so fast
that at last they seemed to skim through the air hardly touching the
ground with their feet till suddenly just as Alice was getting quite
exhausted they stopped and she found herself sitting on the ground
breathless and giddy.

The Queen propped her up against a tree and said kindly You may rest
a little now.

Alice looked round her in great surprise. Why I do believe weve been
under this tree the whole time! Everythings just as it was!

Of course it is said the Queen what would you have it?

Well in OUR country said Alice still panting a little youd
generally get to somewhere else--if you ran very fast for a long time
as weve been doing.

A slow sort of country! said the Queen. Now HERE you see it takes
all the running YOU can do to keep in the same place. If you want to
get somewhere else you must run at least twice as fast as that!

Id rather not try please! said Alice. Im quite content to stay
here--only I AM so hot and thirsty!

I know what YOUD like! the Queen said good-naturedly taking a little
box out of her pocket. Have a biscuit?

Alice thought it would not be civil to say No though it wasnt at all
what she wanted. So she took it and ate it as well as she could: and it
was VERY dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all
her life.

While youre refreshing yourself said the Queen Ill just take
the measurements. And she took a ribbon out of her pocket marked in
inches and began measuring the ground and sticking little pegs in here
and there.

At the end of two yards she said putting in a peg to mark the
distance I shall give you your directions--have another biscuit?

No thank you said Alice: ones QUITE enough!

Thirst quenched I hope? said the Queen.

Alice did not know what to say to this but luckily the Queen did not
wait for an answer but went on. At the end of THREE yards I shall
repeat them--for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of FOUR I
shall say good-bye. And at the end of FIVE I shall go!

She had got all the pegs put in by this time and Alice looked on
with great interest as she returned to the tree and then began slowly
walking down the row.

At the two-yard peg she faced round and said A pawn goes two squares
in its first move you know. So youll go VERY quickly through the Third
Square--by railway I should think--and youll find yourself in the
Fourth Square in no time. Well THAT square belongs to Tweedledum and
Tweedledee--the Fifth is mostly water--the Sixth belongs to Humpty
Dumpty--But you make no remark?

I--I didnt know I had to make one--just then Alice faltered out.

You SHOULD have said Its extremely kind of you to tell me all
this--however well suppose it said--the Seventh Square is all
forest--however one of the Knights will show you the way--and in the
Eighth Square we shall be Queens together and its all feasting and
fun! Alice got up and curtseyed and sat down again.

At the next peg the Queen turned again and this time she said Speak
in French when you cant think of the English for a thing--turn out your
toes as you walk--and remember who you are! She did not wait for Alice
to curtsey this time but walked on quickly to the next peg where she
turned for a moment to say good-bye and then hurried on to the last.

How it happened Alice never knew but exactly as she came to the last
peg she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air or whether she
ran quickly into the wood (and she CAN run very fast! thought Alice)
there was no way of guessing but she was gone and Alice began to
remember that she was a Pawn and that it would soon be time for her to
move.




CHAPTER III. Looking-Glass Insects

Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the
country she was going to travel through. Its something very like
learning geography thought Alice as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of
being able to see a little further. Principal rivers--there ARE none.
Principal mountains--Im on the only one but I dont think its got any
name. Principal towns--why what ARE those creatures making honey down
there? They cant be bees--nobody ever saw bees a mile off you know--
and for some time she stood silent watching one of them that was
bustling about among the flowers poking its proboscis into them just
as if it was a regular bee thought Alice.

However this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an
elephant--as Alice soon found out though the idea quite took her breath
away at first. And what enormous flowers they must be! was her next
idea. Something like cottages with the roofs taken off and stalks put
to them--and what quantities of honey they must make! I think Ill go
down and--no I wont JUST yet she went on checking herself just as
she was beginning to run down the hill and trying to find some excuse
for turning shy so suddenly. Itll never do to go down among them
without a good long branch to brush them away--and what fun itll be
when they ask me how I like my walk. I shall say--Oh I like it well
enough-- (here came the favourite little toss of the head) only it
was so dusty and hot and the elephants did tease so!

I think Ill go down the other way she said after a pause: and
perhaps I may visit the elephants later on. Besides I do so want to get
into the Third Square!

So with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of
the six little brooks.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

Tickets please! said the Guard putting his head in at the window.
In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the same
size as the people and quite seemed to fill the carriage.

Now then! Show your ticket child! the Guard went on looking angrily
at Alice. And a great many voices all said together (like the chorus of
a song thought Alice) Dont keep him waiting child! Why his time
is worth a thousand pounds a minute!

Im afraid I havent got one Alice said in a frightened tone: there
wasnt a ticket-office where I came from. And again the chorus of
voices went on. There wasnt room for one where she came from. The land
there is worth a thousand pounds an inch!

Dont make excuses said the Guard: you should have bought one from
the engine-driver. And once more the chorus of voices went on with The
man that drives the engine. Why the smoke alone is worth a thousand
pounds a puff!

Alice thought to herself Then theres no use in speaking. The
voices didnt join in this time as she hadnt spoken but to her
great surprise they all THOUGHT in chorus (I hope you understand what
THINKING IN CHORUS means--for I must confess that _I_ dont) Better
say nothing at all. Language is worth a thousand pounds a word!

I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight I know I shall! thought
Alice.

All this time the Guard was looking at her first through a telescope
then through a microscope and then through an opera-glass. At last he
said Youre travelling the wrong way and shut up the window and went
away.

So young a child said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was
dressed in white paper) ought to know which way shes going even if
she doesnt know her own name!

A Goat that was sitting next to the gentleman in white shut his
eyes and said in a loud voice She ought to know her way to the
ticket-office even if she doesnt know her alphabet!

There was a Beetle sitting next to the Goat (it was a very queer
carriage-full of passengers altogether) and as the rule seemed to be
that they should all speak in turn HE went on with Shell have to go
back from here as luggage!

Alice couldnt see who was sitting beyond the Beetle but a hoarse voice
spoke next. Change engines-- it said and was obliged to leave off.

It sounds like a horse Alice thought to herself. And an extremely
small voice close to her ear said You might make a joke on
that--something about horse and hoarse you know.

Then a very gentle voice in the distance said She must be labelled
Lass with care you know--

And after that other voices went on (What a number of people there are
in the carriage! thought Alice) saying She must go by post as shes
got a head on her-- She must be sent as a message by the telegraph--
She must draw the train herself the rest of the way-- and so on.

But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered
in her ear Never mind what they all say my dear but take a
return-ticket every time the train stops.

Indeed I shant! Alice said rather impatiently. I dont belong to
this railway journey at all--I was in a wood just now--and I wish I
could get back there.

You might make a joke on THAT said the little voice close to her ear:
something about you WOULD if you could you know.

Dont tease so said Alice looking about in vain to see where the
voice came from; if youre so anxious to have a joke made why dont
you make one yourself?

The little voice sighed deeply: it was VERY unhappy evidently and
Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it If it would only
sigh like other people! she thought. But this was such a wonderfully
small sigh that she wouldnt have heard it at all if it hadnt come
QUITE close to her ear. The consequence of this was that it tickled her
ear very much and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of
the poor little creature.

I know you are a friend the little voice went on; a dear friend and
an old friend. And you wont hurt me though I AM an insect.

What kind of insect? Alice inquired a little anxiously. What she
really wanted to know was whether it could sting or not but she
thought this wouldnt be quite a civil question to ask.

What then you dont-- the little voice began when it was drowned by
a shrill scream from the engine and everybody jumped up in alarm Alice
among the rest.

The Horse who had put his head out of the window quietly drew it in
and said Its only a brook we have to jump over. Everybody seemed
satisfied with this though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of
trains jumping at all. However itll take us into the Fourth Square
thats some comfort! she said to herself. In another moment she felt
the carriage rise straight up into the air and in her fright she caught
at the thing nearest to her hand which happened to be the Goats beard.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

But the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it and she found
herself sitting quietly under a tree--while the Gnat (for that was the
insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over
her head and fanning her with its wings.

It certainly was a VERY large Gnat: about the size of a chicken Alice
thought. Still she couldnt feel nervous with it after they had been
talking together so long.

--then you dont like all insects? the Gnat went on as quietly as if
nothing had happened.

I like them when they can talk Alice said. None of them ever talk
where _I_ come from.

What sort of insects do you rejoice in where YOU come from? the Gnat
inquired.

I dont REJOICE in insects at all Alice explained because Im
rather afraid of them--at least the large kinds. But I can tell you the
names of some of them.

Of course they answer to their names? the Gnat remarked carelessly.

I never knew them to do it.

Whats the use of their having names the Gnat said if they wont
answer to them?

No use to THEM said Alice; but its useful to the people who name
them I suppose. If not why do things have names at all?

I cant say the Gnat replied. Further on in the wood down there
theyve got no names--however go on with your list of insects: youre
wasting time.

Well theres the Horse-fly Alice began counting off the names on
her fingers.

All right said the Gnat: half way up that bush youll see a
Rocking-horse-fly if you look. Its made entirely of wood and gets
about by swinging itself from branch to branch.

What does it live on? Alice asked with great curiosity.

Sap and sawdust said the Gnat. Go on with the list.

Alice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest and made
up her mind that it must have been just repainted it looked so bright
and sticky; and then she went on.

And theres the Dragon-fly.

Look on the branch above your head said the Gnat and there youll
find a snap-dragon-fly. Its body is made of plum-pudding its wings of
holly-leaves and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.

And what does it live on?

Frumenty and mince pie the Gnat replied; and it makes its nest in a
Christmas box.

And then theres the Butterfly Alice went on after she had taken
a good look at the insect with its head on fire and had thought to
herself I wonder if thats the reason insects are so fond of flying
into candles--because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!

Crawling at your feet said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in
some alarm) you may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its wings are thin
slices of Bread-and-butter its body is a crust and its head is a lump
of sugar.

And what does IT live on?

Weak tea with cream in it.

A new difficulty came into Alices head. Supposing it couldnt find
any? she suggested.

Then it would die of course.

But that must happen very often Alice remarked thoughtfully.

It always happens said the Gnat.

After this Alice was silent for a minute or two pondering. The Gnat
amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last
it settled again and remarked I suppose you dont want to lose your
name?

No indeed Alice said a little anxiously.

And yet I dont know the Gnat went on in a careless tone: only think
how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it!
For instance if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons she
would call out come here-- and there she would have to leave off
because there wouldnt be any name for her to call and of course you
wouldnt have to go you know.

That would never do Im sure said Alice: the governess would never
think of excusing me lessons for that. If she couldnt remember my name
shed call me Miss! as the servants do.

Well if she said Miss and didnt say anything more the Gnat
remarked of course youd miss your lessons. Thats a joke. I wish YOU
had made it.

Why do you wish _I_ had made it? Alice asked. Its a very bad one.

But the Gnat only sighed deeply while two large tears came rolling down
its cheeks.

You shouldnt make jokes Alice said if it makes you so unhappy.

Then came another of those melancholy little sighs and this time the
poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away for when Alice
looked up there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig and as
she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long she got up and
walked on.

She very soon came to an open field with a wood on the other side of
it: it looked much darker than the last wood and Alice felt a LITTLE
timid about going into it. However on second thoughts she made up her
mind to go on: for I certainly wont go BACK she thought to herself
and this was the only way to the Eighth Square.

This must be the wood she said thoughtfully to herself where
things have no names. I wonder whatll become of MY name when I go in?
I shouldnt like to lose it at all--because theyd have to give me
another and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. But then
the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old
name! Thats just like the advertisements you know when people lose
dogs--ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF DASH: HAD ON A BRASS COLLAR--just fancy
calling everything you met Alice till one of them answered! Only they
wouldnt answer at all if they were wise.

She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked
very cool and shady. Well at any rate its a great comfort she
said as she stepped under the trees after being so hot to get into
the--into WHAT? she went on rather surprised at not being able to
think of the word. I mean to get under the--under the--under THIS you
know! putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. What DOES it call
itself I wonder? I do believe its got no name--why to be sure it
hasnt!

She stood silent for a minute thinking: then she suddenly began again.
Then it really HAS happened after all! And now who am I? I WILL
remember if I can! Im determined to do it! But being determined
didnt help much and all she could say after a great deal of puzzling
was L I KNOW it begins with L!

Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large
gentle eyes but didnt seem at all frightened. Here then! Here then!
Alice said as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it only
started back a little and then stood looking at her again.

What do you call yourself? the Fawn said at last. Such a soft sweet
voice it had!

I wish I knew! thought poor Alice. She answered rather sadly
Nothing just now.

Think again it said: that wont do.

Alice thought but nothing came of it. Please would you tell me
what YOU call yourself? she said timidly. I think that might help a
little.

Ill tell you if youll move a little further on the Fawn said. I
cant remember here.

So they walked on together though the wood Alice with her arms clasped
lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn till they came out into
another open field and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air
and shook itself free from Alices arms. Im a Fawn! it cried out in a
voice of delight and dear me! youre a human child! A sudden look of
alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes and in another moment it had
darted away at full speed.

Alice stood looking after it almost ready to cry with vexation at
having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. However I
know my name now. she said thats SOME comfort. Alice--Alice--I wont
forget it again. And now which of these finger-posts ought I to follow
I wonder?

It was not a very difficult question to answer as there was only one
road through the wood and the two finger-posts both pointed along it.
Ill settle it Alice said to herself when the road divides and they
point different ways.

But this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on a long way
but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts
pointing the same way one marked TO TWEEDLEDUMS HOUSE and the other
TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.

I do believe said Alice at last that they live in the same house! I
wonder I never thought of that before--But I cant stay there long. Ill
just call and say how dyou do? and ask them the way out of the wood.
If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark! So she
wandered on talking to herself as she went till on turning a sharp
corner she came upon two fat little men so suddenly that she could not
help starting back but in another moment she recovered herself feeling
sure that they must be.




CHAPTER IV. Tweedledum And Tweedledee

They were standing under a tree each with an arm round the others
neck and Alice knew which was which in a moment because one of them
had DUM embroidered on his collar and the other DEE. I suppose
theyve each got TWEEDLE round at the back of the collar she said to
herself.

They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive and she was
just looking round to see if the word TWEEDLE was written at the back
of each collar when she was startled by a voice coming from the one
marked DUM.

If you think were wax-works he said you ought to pay you know.
Wax-works werent made to be looked at for nothing nohow!

Contrariwise added the one marked DEE if you think were alive
you ought to speak.

Im sure Im very sorry was all Alice could say; for the words of the
old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock and
she could hardly help saying them out loud:--


     Tweedledum and Tweedledee
      Agreed to have a battle;
     For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
      Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

     Just then flew down a monstrous crow
      As black as a tar-barrel;
     Which frightened both the heroes so
      They quite forgot their quarrel.

I know what youre thinking about said Tweedledum: but it isnt so
nohow.

Contrariwise continued Tweedledee if it was so it might be; and if
it were so it would be; but as it isnt it aint. Thats logic.

I was thinking Alice said very politely which is the best way out
of this wood: its getting so dark. Would you tell me please?

But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.

They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys that Alice
couldnt help pointing her finger at Tweedledum and saying First Boy!

Nohow! Tweedledum cried out briskly and shut his mouth up again with
a snap.

Next Boy! said Alice passing on to Tweedledee though she felt quite
certain he would only shout out Contrariwise! and so he did.

Youve been wrong! cried Tweedledum. The first thing in a visit is to
say How dye do? and shake hands! And here the two brothers gave each
other a hug and then they held out the two hands that were free to
shake hands with her.

Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first for fear
of hurting the other ones feelings; so as the best way out of the
difficulty she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they
were dancing round in a ring. This seemed quite natural (she remembered
afterwards) and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it
seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing and it was
done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one
across the other like fiddles and fiddle-sticks.

But it certainly WAS funny (Alice said afterwards when she was
telling her sister the history of all this) to find myself singing
HERE WE GO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH. I dont know when I began it but
somehow I felt as if Id been singing it a long long time!

The other two dancers were fat and very soon out of breath. Four times
round is enough for one dance Tweedledum panted out and they left
off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same
moment.

Then they let go of Alices hands and stood looking at her for a
minute: there was a rather awkward pause as Alice didnt know how to
begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. It
would never do to say How dye do? NOW she said to herself: we seem
to have got beyond that somehow!

I hope youre not much tired? she said at last.

Nohow. And thank you VERY much for asking said Tweedledum.

So much obliged! added Tweedledee. You like poetry?

Ye-es pretty well--SOME poetry Alice said doubtfully. Would you
tell me which road leads out of the wood?

What shall I repeat to her? said Tweedledee looking round at
Tweedledum with great solemn eyes and not noticing Alices question.

THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER is the longest Tweedledum replied
giving his brother an affectionate hug.

Tweedledee began instantly:

       The sun was shining--

Here Alice ventured to interrupt him. If its VERY long she said as
politely as she could would you please tell me first which road--

Tweedledee smiled gently and began again:

     The sun was shining on the sea
      Shining with all his might:
     He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright--
     And this was odd because it was
      The middle of the night.

     The moon was shining sulkily
      Because she thought the sun
     Had got no business to be there
      After the day was done--
     Its very rude of him she said
      To come and spoil the fun!

     The sea was wet as wet could be
      The sands were dry as dry.
     You could not see a cloud because
      No cloud was in the sky:
     No birds were flying over head--
      There were no birds to fly.

     The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Were walking close at hand;
     They wept like anything to see
      Such quantities of sand:
     If this were only cleared away
       They said it WOULD be grand!

     If seven maids with seven mops
      Swept it for half a year
     Do you suppose the Walrus said
      That they could get it clear?
      I doubt it said the Carpenter
      And shed a bitter tear.

     O Oysters come and walk with us!
       The Walrus did beseech.
     A pleasant walk a pleasant talk
      Along the briny beach:
     We cannot do with more than four
      To give a hand to each.

     The eldest Oyster looked at him.
      But never a word he said:
     The eldest Oyster winked his eye
      And shook his heavy head--
     Meaning to say he did not choose
      To leave the oyster-bed.

     But four young oysters hurried up
      All eager for the treat:
     Their coats were brushed their faces washed
      Their shoes were clean and neat--
     And this was odd because you know
      They hadnt any feet.

     Four other Oysters followed them
      And yet another four;
     And thick and fast they came at last
      And more and more and more--
     All hopping through the frothy waves
      And scrambling to the shore.

     The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Walked on a mile or so
     And then they rested on a rock
      Conveniently low:
     And all the little Oysters stood
      And waited in a row.

     The time has come the Walrus said
      To talk of many things:
     Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
      Of cabbages--and kings--
     And why the sea is boiling hot--
      And whether pigs have wings.

     But wait a bit the Oysters cried
      Before we have our chat;
     For some of us are out of breath
      And all of us are fat!
      No hurry! said the Carpenter.
      They thanked him much for that.

     A loaf of bread the Walrus said
      Is what we chiefly need:
     Pepper and vinegar besides
      Are very good indeed--
     Now if youre ready Oysters dear
      We can begin to feed.

     But not on us! the Oysters cried
      Turning a little blue
     After such kindness that would be
      A dismal thing to do!
      The night is fine the Walrus said
      Do you admire the view?

     It was so kind of you to come!
      And you are very nice!
      The Carpenter said nothing but
      Cut us another slice:
     I wish you were not quite so deaf--
      Ive had to ask you twice!

     It seems a shame the Walrus said
      To play them such a trick
     After weve brought them out so far
      And made them trot so quick!
      The Carpenter said nothing but
      The butters spread too thick!

     I weep for you the Walrus said.
      I deeply sympathize.
      With sobs and tears he sorted out
      Those of the largest size.
     Holding his pocket handkerchief
      Before his streaming eyes.

     O Oysters said the Carpenter.
      Youve had a pleasant run!
     Shall we be trotting home again?
       But answer came there none--
     And that was scarcely odd because
      Theyd eaten every one.

I like the Walrus best said Alice: because you see he was a LITTLE
sorry for the poor oysters.

He ate more than the Carpenter though said Tweedledee. You see he
held his handkerchief in front so that the Carpenter couldnt count how
many he took: contrariwise.

That was mean! Alice said indignantly. Then I like the Carpenter
best--if he didnt eat so many as the Walrus.

But he ate as many as he could get said Tweedledum.

This was a puzzler. After a pause Alice began Well! They were BOTH
very unpleasant characters-- Here she checked herself in some alarm
at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large
steam-engine in the wood near them though she feared it was more likely
to be a wild beast. Are there any lions or tigers about here? she
asked timidly.

Its only the Red King snoring said Tweedledee.

Come and look at him! the brothers cried and they each took one of
Alices hands and led her up to where the King was sleeping.

Isnt he a LOVELY sight? said Tweedledum.

Alice couldnt say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-cap on
with a tassel and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap
and snoring loud--fit to snore his head off! as Tweedledum remarked.

Im afraid hell catch cold with lying on the damp grass said Alice
who was a very thoughtful little girl.

Hes dreaming now said Tweedledee: and what do you think hes
dreaming about?

Alice said Nobody can guess that.

Why about YOU! Tweedledee exclaimed clapping his hands triumphantly.
And if he left off dreaming about you where do you suppose youd be?

Where I am now of course said Alice.

Not you! Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. Youd be nowhere. Why
youre only a sort of thing in his dream!

If that there King was to wake added Tweedledum youd go
out--bang!--just like a candle!

I shouldnt! Alice exclaimed indignantly. Besides if IM only a sort
of thing in his dream what are YOU I should like to know?

Ditto said Tweedledum.

Ditto ditto cried Tweedledee.

He shouted this so loud that Alice couldnt help saying Hush! Youll
be waking him Im afraid if you make so much noise.

Well it no use YOUR talking about waking him said Tweedledum when
youre only one of the things in his dream. You know very well youre
not real.

I AM real! said Alice and began to cry.

You wont make yourself a bit realler by crying Tweedledee remarked:
theres nothing to cry about.

If I wasnt real Alice said--half-laughing through her tears it all
seemed so ridiculous--I shouldnt be able to cry.

I hope you dont suppose those are real tears? Tweedledum interrupted
in a tone of great contempt.

I know theyre talking nonsense Alice thought to herself: and its
foolish to cry about it. So she brushed away her tears and went on as
cheerfully as she could. At any rate Id better be getting out of the
wood for really its coming on very dark. Do you think its going to
rain?

Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother and
looked up into it. No I dont think it is he said: at least--not
under HERE. Nohow.

But it may rain OUTSIDE?

It may--if it chooses said Tweedledee: weve no objection.
Contrariwise.

Selfish things! thought Alice and she was just going to say
Good-night and leave them when Tweedledum sprang out from under the
umbrella and seized her by the wrist.

Do you see THAT? he said in a voice choking with passion and
his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment as he pointed with a
trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree.

Its only a rattle Alice said after a careful examination of the
little white thing. Not a rattleSNAKE you know she added hastily
thinking that he was frightened: only an old rattle--quite old and
broken.

I knew it was! cried Tweedledum beginning to stamp about wildly and
tear his hair. Its spoilt of course! Here he looked at Tweedledee
who immediately sat down on the ground and tried to hide himself under
the umbrella.

Alice laid her hand upon his arm and said in a soothing tone You
neednt be so angry about an old rattle.

But it isnt old! Tweedledum cried in a greater fury than ever. Its
new I tell you--I bought it yesterday--my nice new RATTLE! and his
voice rose to a perfect scream.

All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella
with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do that it
quite took off Alices attention from the angry brother. But he couldnt
quite succeed and it ended in his rolling over bundled up in the
umbrella with only his head out: and there he lay opening and shutting
his mouth and his large eyes--looking more like a fish than anything
else Alice thought.

Of course you agree to have a battle? Tweedledum said in a calmer
tone.

I suppose so the other sulkily replied as he crawled out of the
umbrella: only SHE must help us to dress up you know.

So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood and returned
in a minute with their arms full of things--such as bolsters blankets
hearth-rugs table-cloths dish-covers and coal-scuttles. I hope youre
a good hand at pinning and tying strings? Tweedledum remarked. Every
one of these things has got to go on somehow or other.

Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything
in all her life--the way those two bustled about--and the quantity of
things they put on--and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and
fastening buttons--Really theyll be more like bundles of old clothes
than anything else by the time theyre ready! she said to herself as
she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee to keep his head
from being cut off as he said.

You know he added very gravely its one of the most serious things
that can possibly happen to one in a battle--to get ones head cut off.

Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough for fear
of hurting his feelings.

Do I look very pale? said Tweedledum coming up to have his helmet
tied on. (He CALLED it a helmet though it certainly looked much more
like a saucepan.)

Well--yes--a LITTLE Alice replied gently.

Im very brave generally he went on in a low voice: only to-day I
happen to have a headache.

And IVE got a toothache! said Tweedledee who had overheard the
remark. Im far worse off than you!

Then youd better not fight to-day said Alice thinking it a good
opportunity to make peace.

We MUST have a bit of a fight but I dont care about going on long
said Tweedledum. Whats the time now?

Tweedledee looked at his watch and said Half-past four.

Lets fight till six and then have dinner said Tweedledum.

Very well the other said rather sadly: and SHE can watch us--only
youd better not come VERY close he added: I generally hit everything
I can see--when I get really excited.

And _I_ hit everything within reach cried Tweedledum whether I can
see it or not!

Alice laughed. You must hit the TREES pretty often I should think
she said.

Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. I dont suppose
he said therell be a tree left standing for ever so far round by
the time weve finished!

And all about a rattle! said Alice still hoping to make them a LITTLE
ashamed of fighting for such a trifle.

I shouldnt have minded it so much said Tweedledum if it hadnt
been a new one.

I wish the monstrous crow would come! thought Alice.

Theres only one sword you know Tweedledum said to his brother:
but you can have the umbrella--its quite as sharp. Only we must begin
quick. Its getting as dark as it can.

And darker said Tweedledee.

It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a
thunderstorm coming on. What a thick black cloud that is! she said.
And how fast it comes! Why I do believe its got wings!

Its the crow! Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and
the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment.

Alice ran a little way into the wood and stopped under a large tree.
It can never get at me HERE she thought: its far too large to
squeeze itself in among the trees. But I wish it wouldnt flap its wings
so--it makes quite a hurricane in the wood--heres somebodys shawl
being blown away!




CHAPTER V. Wool and Water

She caught the shawl as she spoke and looked about for the owner: in
another moment the White Queen came running wildly through the wood
with both arms stretched out wide as if she were flying and Alice very
civilly went to meet her with the shawl.

Im very glad I happened to be in the way Alice said as she helped
her to put on her shawl again.

The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way
and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like
bread-and-butter bread-and-butter and Alice felt that if there was
to be any conversation at all she must manage it herself. So she began
rather timidly: Am I addressing the White Queen?

Well yes if you call that a-dressing The Queen said. It isnt MY
notion of the thing at all.

Alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very
beginning of their conversation so she smiled and said If your
Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin Ill do it as well as
I can.

But I dont want it done at all! groaned the poor Queen. Ive been
a-dressing myself for the last two hours.

It would have been all the better as it seemed to Alice if she had got
some one else to dress her she was so dreadfully untidy. Every
single things crooked Alice thought to herself and shes all over
pins!--may I put your shawl straight for you? she added aloud.

I dont know whats the matter with it! the Queen said in a
melancholy voice. Its out of temper I think. Ive pinned it here and
Ive pinned it there but theres no pleasing it!

It CANT go straight you know if you pin it all on one side Alice
said as she gently put it right for her; and dear me what a state
your hair is in!

The brush has got entangled in it! the Queen said with a sigh. And I
lost the comb yesterday.

Alice carefully released the brush and did her best to get the hair
into order. Come you look rather better now! she said after altering
most of the pins. But really you should have a ladys maid!

Im sure Ill take you with pleasure! the Queen said. Twopence a
week and jam every other day.

Alice couldnt help laughing as she said I dont want you to hire
ME--and I dont care for jam.

Its very good jam said the Queen.

Well I dont want any TO-DAY at any rate.

You couldnt have it if you DID want it the Queen said. The rule is
jam to-morrow and jam yesterday--but never jam to-day.

It MUST come sometimes to jam to-day Alice objected.

No it cant said the Queen. Its jam every OTHER day: to-day isnt
any OTHER day you know.

I dont understand you said Alice. Its dreadfully confusing!

Thats the effect of living backwards the Queen said kindly: it
always makes one a little giddy at first--

Living backwards! Alice repeated in great astonishment. I never heard
of such a thing!

--but theres one great advantage in it that ones memory works both
ways.

Im sure MINE only works one way Alice remarked. I cant remember
things before they happen.

Its a poor sort of memory that only works backwards the Queen
remarked.

What sort of things do YOU remember best? Alice ventured to ask.

Oh things that happened the week after next the Queen replied in a
careless tone. For instance now she went on sticking a large piece
of plaster on her finger as she spoke theres the Kings
Messenger. Hes in prison now being punished: and the trial doesnt
even begin till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of
all.

Suppose he never commits the crime? said Alice.

That would be all the better wouldnt it? the Queen said as she
bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.

Alice felt there was no denying THAT. Of course it would be all
the better she said: but it wouldnt be all the better his being
punished.

Youre wrong THERE at any rate said the Queen: were YOU ever
punished?

Only for faults said Alice.

And you were all the better for it I know! the Queen said
triumphantly.

Yes but then I HAD done the things I was punished for said Alice:
that makes all the difference.

But if you HADNT done them the Queen said that would have been
better still; better and better and better! Her voice went higher
with each better till it got quite to a squeak at last.

Alice was just beginning to say Theres a mistake somewhere-- when
the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence
unfinished. Oh oh oh! shouted the Queen shaking her hand about as
if she wanted to shake it off. My fingers bleeding! Oh oh oh oh!

Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine that
Alice had to hold both her hands over her ears.

What IS the matter? she said as soon as there was a chance of making
herself heard. Have you pricked your finger?

I havent pricked it YET the Queen said but I soon shall--oh oh
oh!

When do you expect to do it? Alice asked feeling very much inclined
to laugh.

When I fasten my shawl again the poor Queen groaned out: the brooch
will come undone directly. Oh oh! As she said the words the brooch
flew open and the Queen clutched wildly at it and tried to clasp it
again.

Take care! cried Alice. Youre holding it all crooked! And she
caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped and the
Queen had pricked her finger.

That accounts for the bleeding you see she said to Alice with a
smile. Now you understand the way things happen here.

But why dont you scream now? Alice asked holding her hands ready to
put over her ears again.

Why Ive done all the screaming already said the Queen. What would
be the good of having it all over again?

By this time it was getting light. The crow must have flown away I
think said Alice: Im so glad its gone. I thought it was the night
coming on.

I wish _I_ could manage to be glad! the Queen said. Only I never
can remember the rule. You must be very happy living in this wood and
being glad whenever you like!

Only it is so VERY lonely here! Alice said in a melancholy voice; and
at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her
cheeks.

Oh dont go on like that! cried the poor Queen wringing her hands in
despair. Consider what a great girl you are. Consider what a long way
youve come to-day. Consider what oclock it is. Consider anything only
dont cry!

Alice could not help laughing at this even in the midst of her tears.
Can YOU keep from crying by considering things? she asked.

Thats the way its done the Queen said with great decision: nobody
can do two things at once you know. Lets consider your age to begin
with--how old are you?

Im seven and a half exactly.

You neednt say exactually the Queen remarked: I can believe
it without that. Now Ill give YOU something to believe. Im just one
hundred and one five months and a day.

I cant believe THAT! said Alice.

Cant you? the Queen said in a pitying tone. Try again: draw a long
breath and shut your eyes.

Alice laughed. Theres no use trying she said: one CANT believe
impossible things.

I daresay you havent had much practice said the Queen. When I was
your age I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why sometimes Ive
believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goes
the shawl again!

The brooch had come undone as she spoke and a sudden gust of wind blew
the Queens shawl across a little brook. The Queen spread out her arms
again and went flying after it and this time she succeeded in catching
it for herself. Ive got it! she cried in a triumphant tone. Now you
shall see me pin it on again all by myself!

Then I hope your finger is better now? Alice said very politely as
she crossed the little brook after the Queen.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

Oh much better! cried the Queen her voice rising to a squeak as she
went on. Much be-etter! Be-etter! Be-e-e-etter! Be-e-ehh! The last
word ended in a long bleat so like a sheep that Alice quite started.

She looked at the Queen who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up
in wool. Alice rubbed her eyes and looked again. She couldnt make out
what had happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was that really--was it
really a SHEEP that was sitting on the other side of the counter? Rub as
she could she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark
shop leaning with her elbows on the counter and opposite to her was
an old Sheep sitting in an arm-chair knitting and every now and then
leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.

What is it you want to buy? the Sheep said at last looking up for a
moment from her knitting.

I dont QUITE know yet Alice said very gently. I should like to
look all round me first if I might.

You may look in front of you and on both sides if you like said the
Sheep: but you cant look ALL round you--unless youve got eyes at the
back of your head.

But these as it happened Alice had NOT got: so she contented herself
with turning round looking at the shelves as she came to them.

The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things--but the
oddest part of it all was that whenever she looked hard at any shelf
to make out exactly what it had on it that particular shelf was always
quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they
could hold.

Things flow about so here! she said at last in a plaintive tone after
she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing
that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box and was
always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at. And this one
is the most provoking of all--but Ill tell you what-- she added as a
sudden thought struck her Ill follow it up to the very top shelf of
all. Itll puzzle it to go through the ceiling I expect!

But even this plan failed: the thing went through the ceiling as
quietly as possible as if it were quite used to it.

Are you a child or a teetotum? the Sheep said as she took up another
pair of needles. Youll make me giddy soon if you go on turning round
like that. She was now working with fourteen pairs at once and Alice
couldnt help looking at her in great astonishment.

How CAN she knit with so many? the puzzled child thought to herself.
She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!

Can you row? the Sheep asked handing her a pair of knitting-needles
as she spoke.

Yes a little--but not on land--and not with needles-- Alice was
beginning to say when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her
hands and she found they were in a little boat gliding along between
banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best.

Feather! cried the Sheep as she took up another pair of needles.

This didnt sound like a remark that needed any answer so Alice said
nothing but pulled away. There was something very queer about the
water she thought as every now and then the oars got fast in it and
would hardly come out again.

Feather! Feather! the Sheep cried again taking more needles. Youll
be catching a crab directly.

A dear little crab! thought Alice. I should like that.

Didnt you hear me say Feather? the Sheep cried angrily taking up
quite a bunch of needles.

Indeed I did said Alice: youve said it very often--and very loud.
Please where ARE the crabs?

In the water of course! said the Sheep sticking some of the needles
into her hair as her hands were full. Feather I say!

WHY do you say feather so often? Alice asked at last rather vexed.
Im not a bird!

You are said the Sheep: youre a little goose.

This offended Alice a little so there was no more conversation for a
minute or two while the boat glided gently on sometimes among beds of
weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water worse then ever)
and sometimes under trees but always with the same tall river-banks
frowning over their heads.

Oh please! There are some scented rushes! Alice cried in a sudden
transport of delight. There really are--and SUCH beauties!

You neednt say please to ME about em the Sheep said without
looking up from her knitting: I didnt put em there and Im not going
to take em away.

No but I meant--please may we wait and pick some? Alice pleaded. If
you dont mind stopping the boat for a minute.

How am _I_ to stop it? said the Sheep. If you leave off rowing itll
stop of itself.

So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would till it
glided gently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves
were carefully rolled up and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep
to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off--and for
a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting as she
bent over the side of the boat with just the ends of her tangled hair
dipping into the water--while with bright eager eyes she caught at one
bunch after another of the darling scented rushes.

I only hope the boat wont tipple over! she said to herself. Oh WHAT
a lovely one! Only I couldnt quite reach it. And it certainly DID
seem a little provoking (almost as if it happened on purpose she
thought) that though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as
the boat glided by there was always a more lovely one that she couldnt
reach.

The prettiest are always further! she said at last with a sigh at the
obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off as with flushed cheeks
and dripping hair and hands she scrambled back into her place and
began to arrange her new-found treasures.

What mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade and
to lose all their scent and beauty from the very moment that she
picked them? Even real scented rushes you know last only a very little
while--and these being dream-rushes melted away almost like snow as
they lay in heaps at her feet--but Alice hardly noticed this there were
so many other curious things to think about.

They hadnt gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got
fast in the water and WOULDNT come out again (so Alice explained it
afterwards) and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her
under the chin and in spite of a series of little shrieks of Oh oh
oh! from poor Alice it swept her straight off the seat and down among
the heap of rushes.

However she wasnt hurt and was soon up again: the Sheep went on with
her knitting all the while just as if nothing had happened. That was
a nice crab you caught! she remarked as Alice got back into her place
very much relieved to find herself still in the boat.

Was it? I didnt see it Said Alice peeping cautiously over the side
of the boat into the dark water. I wish it hadnt let go--I should
so like to see a little crab to take home with me! But the Sheep only
laughed scornfully and went on with her knitting.

Are there many crabs here? said Alice.

Crabs and all sorts of things said the Sheep: plenty of choice
only make up your mind. Now what DO you want to buy?

To buy! Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half
frightened--for the oars and the boat and the river had vanished all
in a moment and she was back again in the little dark shop.

I should like to buy an egg please she said timidly. How do you
sell them?

Fivepence farthing for one--Twopence for two the Sheep replied.

Then two are cheaper than one? Alice said in a surprised tone taking
out her purse.

Only you MUST eat them both if you buy two said the Sheep.

Then Ill have ONE please said Alice as she put the money down on
the counter. For she thought to herself They mightnt be at all nice
you know.

The Sheep took the money and put it away in a box: then she said I
never put things into peoples hands--that would never do--you must get
it for yourself. And so saying she went off to the other end of the
shop and set the egg upright on a shelf.

I wonder WHY it wouldnt do? thought Alice as she groped her way
among the tables and chairs for the shop was very dark towards the end.
The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it. Let me
see is this a chair? Why its got branches I declare! How very odd to
find trees growing here! And actually heres a little brook! Well this
is the very queerest shop I ever saw!

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *


So she went on wondering more and more at every step as everything
turned into a tree the moment she came up to it and she quite expected
the egg to do the same.




CHAPTER VI. Humpty Dumpty

However the egg only got larger and larger and more and more human:
when she had come within a few yards of it she saw that it had eyes
and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it she saw clearly
that it was HUMPTY DUMPTY himself. It cant be anybody else! she said
to herself. Im as certain of it as if his name were written all over
his face.

It might have been written a hundred times easily on that enormous
face. Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed like a Turk on
the top of a high wall--such a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how
he could keep his balance--and as his eyes were steadily fixed in the
opposite direction and he didnt take the least notice of her she
thought he must be a stuffed figure after all.

And how exactly like an egg he is! she said aloud standing with her
hands ready to catch him for she was every moment expecting him to
fall.

Its VERY provoking Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence looking
away from Alice as he spoke to be called an egg--VERY!

I said you LOOKED like an egg Sir Alice gently explained. And some
eggs are very pretty you know she added hoping to turn her remark
into a sort of a compliment.

Some people said Humpty Dumpty looking away from her as usual have
no more sense than a baby!

Alice didnt know what to say to this: it wasnt at all like
conversation she thought as he never said anything to HER; in fact
his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree--so she stood and
softly repeated to herself:--


     Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:
     Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
     All the Kings horses and all the Kings men
     Couldnt put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.


That last line is much too long for the poetry she added almost out
loud forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her.

Dont stand there chattering to yourself like that Humpty Dumpty
said looking at her for the first time but tell me your name and your
business.

My NAME is Alice but--

Its a stupid enough name! Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently.
What does it mean?

MUST a name mean something? Alice asked doubtfully.

Of course it must Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: MY name
means the shape I am--and a good handsome shape it is too. With a name
like yours you might be any shape almost.

Why do you sit out here all alone? said Alice not wishing to begin an
argument.

Why because theres nobody with me! cried Humpty Dumpty. Did you
think I didnt know the answer to THAT? Ask another.

Dont you think youd be safer down on the ground? Alice went on not
with any idea of making another riddle but simply in her good-natured
anxiety for the queer creature. That wall is so VERY narrow!

What tremendously easy riddles you ask! Humpty Dumpty growled out. Of
course I dont think so! Why if ever I DID fall off--which theres no
chance of--but IF I did-- Here he pursed up his lips and looked so solemn
and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing. IF I did fall he
went on THE KING HAS PROMISED ME--ah you may turn pale if you like!
You didnt think I was going to say that did you? THE KING HAS PROMISED ME--
WITH HIS VERY OWN MOUTH--to--to--

To send all his horses and all his men Alice interrupted rather
unwisely.

Now I declare thats too bad! Humpty Dumpty cried breaking into a
sudden passion. Youve been listening at doors--and behind trees--and
down chimneys--or you couldnt have known it!

I havent indeed! Alice said very gently. Its in a book.

Ah well! They may write such things in a BOOK Humpty Dumpty said in
a calmer tone. Thats what you call a History of England that is.
Now take a good look at me! Im one that has spoken to a King _I_ am:
mayhap youll never see such another: and to show you Im not proud you
may shake hands with me! And he grinned almost from ear to ear as he
leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so)
and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little anxiously as she
took it. If he smiled much more the ends of his mouth might meet
behind she thought: and then I dont know what would happen to his
head! Im afraid it would come off!

Yes all his horses and all his men Humpty Dumpty went on. Theyd
pick me up again in a minute THEY would! However this conversation is
going on a little too fast: lets go back to the last remark but one.

Im afraid I cant quite remember it Alice said very politely.

In that case we start fresh said Humpty Dumpty and its my turn
to choose a subject-- (He talks about it just as if it was a game!
thought Alice.) So heres a question for you. How old did you say you
were?

Alice made a short calculation and said Seven years and six months.

Wrong! Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly. You never said a word
like it!

I though you meant How old ARE you? Alice explained.

If Id meant that Id have said it said Humpty Dumpty.

Alice didnt want to begin another argument so she said nothing.

Seven years and six months! Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully. An
uncomfortable sort of age. Now if youd asked MY advice Id have said
Leave off at seven--but its too late now.

I never ask advice about growing Alice said indignantly.

Too proud? the other inquired.

Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. I mean she said
that one cant help growing older.

ONE cant perhaps said Humpty Dumpty but TWO can. With proper
assistance you might have left off at seven.

What a beautiful belt youve got on! Alice suddenly remarked.

(They had had quite enough of the subject of age she thought: and if
they really were to take turns in choosing subjects it was her turn
now.) At least she corrected herself on second thoughts a beautiful
cravat I should have said--no a belt I mean--I beg your pardon! she
added in dismay for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly offended and she
began to wish she hadnt chosen that subject. If I only knew she
thought to herself which was neck and which was waist!

Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry though he said nothing for a
minute or two. When he DID speak again it was in a deep growl.

It is a--MOST--PROVOKING--thing he said at last when a person
doesnt know a cravat from a belt!

I know its very ignorant of me Alice said in so humble a tone that
Humpty Dumpty relented.

Its a cravat child and a beautiful one as you say. Its a present
from the White King and Queen. There now!

Is it really? said Alice quite pleased to find that she HAD chosen a
good subject after all.

They gave it me Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully as he crossed
one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it they gave it
me--for an un-birthday present.

I beg your pardon? Alice said with a puzzled air.

Im not offended said Humpty Dumpty.

I mean what IS an un-birthday present?

A present given when it isnt your birthday of course.

Alice considered a little. I like birthday presents best she said at
last.

You dont know what youre talking about! cried Humpty Dumpty. How
many days are there in a year?

Three hundred and sixty-five said Alice.

And how many birthdays have you?

One.

And if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five what remains?

Three hundred and sixty-four of course.

Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful. Id rather see that done on paper he
said.

Alice couldnt help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book and
worked the sum for him:


               365
                1
               ____

               364
               ___

Humpty Dumpty took the book and looked at it carefully. That seems to
be done right-- he began.

Youre holding it upside down! Alice interrupted.

To be sure I was! Humpty Dumpty said gaily as she turned it round for
him. I thought it looked a little queer. As I was saying that SEEMS
to be done right--though I havent time to look it over thoroughly just
now--and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days
when you might get un-birthday presents--

Certainly said Alice.

And only ONE for birthday presents you know. Theres glory for you!

I dont know what you mean by glory Alice said.

Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. Of course you dont--till I tell
you. I meant theres a nice knock-down argument for you!

But glory doesnt mean a nice knock-down argument Alice objected.

When _I_ use a word Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it
means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less.

The question is said Alice whether you CAN make words mean so many
different things.

The question is said Humpty Dumpty which is to be master--thats
all.

Alice was too much puzzled to say anything so after a minute Humpty
Dumpty began again. Theyve a temper some of them--particularly verbs
theyre the proudest--adjectives you can do anything with but not
verbs--however _I_ can manage the whole lot of them! Impenetrability!
Thats what _I_ say!

Would you tell me please said Alice what that means?

Now you talk like a reasonable child said Humpty Dumpty looking very
much pleased. I meant by impenetrability that weve had enough of
that subject and it would be just as well if youd mention what you
mean to do next as I suppose you dont mean to stop here all the rest
of your life.

Thats a great deal to make one word mean Alice said in a thoughtful
tone.

When I make a word do a lot of work like that said Humpty Dumpty I
always pay it extra.

Oh! said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other remark.

Ah you should see em come round me of a Saturday night Humpty
Dumpty went on wagging his head gravely from side to side: for to get
their wages you know.

(Alice didnt venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see I
cant tell YOU.)

You seem very clever at explaining words Sir said Alice. Would you
kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called Jabberwocky?

Lets hear it said Humpty Dumpty. I can explain all the poems that
were ever invented--and a good many that havent been invented just
yet.

This sounded very hopeful so Alice repeated the first verse:

     Twas brillig and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

Thats enough to begin with Humpty Dumpty interrupted: there
are plenty of hard words there. BRILLIG means four oclock in the
afternoon--the time when you begin BROILING things for dinner.

Thatll do very well said Alice: and SLITHY?

Well SLITHY means lithe and slimy. Lithe is the same as
active. You see its like a portmanteau--there are two meanings packed
up into one word.

I see it now Alice remarked thoughtfully: and what are TOVES?

Well TOVES are something like badgers--theyre something like
lizards--and theyre something like corkscrews.

They must be very curious looking creatures.

They are that said Humpty Dumpty: also they make their nests under
sun-dials--also they live on cheese.

And whats the GYRE and to GIMBLE?

To GYRE is to go round and round like a gyroscope. To GIMBLE is to
make holes like a gimlet.

And THE WABE is the grass-plot round a sun-dial I suppose? said
Alice surprised at her own ingenuity.

Of course it is. Its called WABE you know because it goes a long
way before it and a long way behind it--

And a long way beyond it on each side Alice added.

Exactly so. Well then MIMSY is flimsy and miserable (theres
another portmanteau for you). And a BOROGOVE is a thin shabby-looking
bird with its feathers sticking out all round--something like a live
mop.

And then MOME RATHS? said Alice. Im afraid Im giving you a great
deal of trouble.

Well a RATH is a sort of green pig: but MOME Im not certain
about. I think its short for from home--meaning that theyd lost
their way you know.

And what does OUTGRABE mean?

Well OUTGRABING is something between bellowing and whistling with a
kind of sneeze in the middle: however youll hear it done maybe--down
in the wood yonder--and when youve once heard it youll be QUITE
content. Whos been repeating all that hard stuff to you?

I read it in a book said Alice. But I had some poetry repeated to
me much easier than that by--Tweedledee I think it was.

As to poetry you know said Humpty Dumpty stretching out one of his
great hands _I_ can repeat poetry as well as other folk if it comes
to that--

Oh it neednt come to that! Alice hastily said hoping to keep him
from beginning.

The piece Im going to repeat he went on without noticing her remark
was written entirely for your amusement.

Alice felt that in that case she really OUGHT to listen to it so she
sat down and said Thank you rather sadly.


     In winter when the fields are white
     I sing this song for your delight--


only I dont sing it he added as an explanation.

I see you dont said Alice.

If you can SEE whether Im singing or not youve sharper eyes than
most. Humpty Dumpty remarked severely. Alice was silent.


     In spring when woods are getting green
     Ill try and tell you what I mean.


Thank you very much said Alice.


     In summer when the days are long
     Perhaps youll understand the song:
     In autumn when the leaves are brown
     Take pen and ink and write it down.


I will if I can remember it so long said Alice.

You neednt go on making remarks like that Humpty Dumpty said:
theyre not sensible and they put me out.

     I sent a message to the fish:
     I told them This is what I wish.

     The little fishes of the sea
     They sent an answer back to me.

     The little fishes answer was
     We cannot do it Sir because--


Im afraid I dont quite understand said Alice.

It gets easier further on Humpty Dumpty replied.


     I sent to them again to say
     It will be better to obey.

     The fishes answered with a grin
     Why what a temper you are in!

     I told them once I told them twice:
     They would not listen to advice.

     I took a kettle large and new
     Fit for the deed I had to do.

     My heart went hop my heart went thump;
     I filled the kettle at the pump.

     Then some one came to me and said
     The little fishes are in bed.

     I said to him I said it plain
     Then you must wake them up again.

     I said it very loud and clear;
     I went and shouted in his ear.


Humpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this
verse and Alice thought with a shudder I wouldnt have been the
messenger for ANYTHING!


     But he was very stiff and proud;
     He said You neednt shout so loud!

     And he was very proud and stiff;
     He said Id go and wake them if--

     I took a corkscrew from the shelf:
     I went to wake them up myself.

     And when I found the door was locked
     I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.

     And when I found the door was shut
     I tried to turn the handle but--


There was a long pause.

Is that all? Alice timidly asked.

Thats all said Humpty Dumpty. Good-bye.

This was rather sudden Alice thought: but after such a VERY strong
hint that she ought to be going she felt that it would hardly be civil
to stay. So she got up and held out her hand. Good-bye till we meet
again! she said as cheerfully as she could.

I shouldnt know you again if we DID meet Humpty Dumpty replied in
a discontented tone giving her one of his fingers to shake; youre so
exactly like other people.

The face is what one goes by generally Alice remarked in a
thoughtful tone.

Thats just what I complain of said Humpty Dumpty. Your face is the
same as everybody has--the two eyes so-- (marking their places in the
air with this thumb) nose in the middle mouth under. Its always the
same. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose for
instance--or the mouth at the top--that would be SOME help.

It wouldnt look nice Alice objected. But Humpty Dumpty only shut his
eyes and said Wait till youve tried.

Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again but as he never
opened his eyes or took any further notice of her she said Good-bye!
once more and getting no answer to this she quietly walked away:
but she couldnt help saying to herself as she went Of all the
unsatisfactory-- (she repeated this aloud as it was a great comfort to
have such a long word to say) of all the unsatisfactory people I EVER
met-- She never finished the sentence for at this moment a heavy crash
shook the forest from end to end.




CHAPTER VII. The Lion and the Unicorn

The next moment soldiers came running through the wood at first in twos
and threes then ten or twenty together and at last in such crowds that
they seemed to fill the whole forest. Alice got behind a tree for fear
of being run over and watched them go by.

She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so
uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or
other and whenever one went down several more always fell over him so
that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men.

Then came the horses. Having four feet these managed rather better than
the foot-soldiers: but even THEY stumbled now and then; and it seemed
to be a regular rule that whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off
instantly. The confusion got worse every moment and Alice was very glad
to get out of the wood into an open place where she found the White
King seated on the ground busily writing in his memorandum-book.

Ive sent them all! the King cried in a tone of delight on seeing
Alice. Did you happen to meet any soldiers my dear as you came
through the wood?

Yes I did said Alice: several thousand I should think.

Four thousand two hundred and seven thats the exact number the King
said referring to his book. I couldnt send all the horses you know
because two of them are wanted in the game. And I havent sent the two
Messengers either. Theyre both gone to the town. Just look along the
road and tell me if you can see either of them.

I see nobody on the road said Alice.

I only wish _I_ had such eyes the King remarked in a fretful tone.
To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance too! Why its as much
as _I_ can do to see real people by this light!

All this was lost on Alice who was still looking intently along
the road shading her eyes with one hand. I see somebody now! she
exclaimed at last. But hes coming very slowly--and what curious
attitudes he goes into! (For the messenger kept skipping up and down
and wriggling like an eel as he came along with his great hands spread
out like fans on each side.)

Not at all said the King. Hes an Anglo-Saxon Messenger--and those
are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. He only does them when hes happy. His name
is Haigha. (He pronounced it so as to rhyme with mayor.)

I love my love with an H Alice couldnt help beginning because
he is Happy. I hate him with an H because he is Hideous. I fed him
with--with--with Ham-sandwiches and Hay. His name is Haigha and he
lives--

He lives on the Hill the King remarked simply without the least idea
that he was joining in the game while Alice was still hesitating for
the name of a town beginning with H. The other Messengers called
Hatta. I must have TWO you know--to come and go. One to come and one
to go.

I beg your pardon? said Alice.

It isnt respectable to beg said the King.

I only meant that I didnt understand said Alice. Why one to come
and one to go?

Didnt I tell you? the King repeated impatiently. I must have Two--to
fetch and carry. One to fetch and one to carry.

At this moment the Messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath
to say a word and could only wave his hands about and make the most
fearful faces at the poor King.

This young lady loves you with an H the King said introducing Alice
in the hope of turning off the Messengers attention from himself--but
it was no use--the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary
every moment while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side.

You alarm me! said the King. I feel faint--Give me a ham sandwich!

On which the Messenger to Alices great amusement opened a bag that
hung round his neck and handed a sandwich to the King who devoured it
greedily.

Another sandwich! said the King.

Theres nothing but hay left now the Messenger said peeping into the
bag.

Hay then the King murmured in a faint whisper.

Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. Theres nothing
like eating hay when youre faint he remarked to her as he munched
away.

I should think throwing cold water over you would be better Alice
suggested: or some sal-volatile.

I didnt say there was nothing BETTER the King replied. I said there
was nothing LIKE it. Which Alice did not venture to deny.

Who did you pass on the road? the King went on holding out his hand
to the Messenger for some more hay.

Nobody said the Messenger.

Quite right said the King: this young lady saw him too. So of course
Nobody walks slower than you.

I do my best the Messenger said in a sulky tone. Im sure nobody
walks much faster than I do!

He cant do that said the King or else hed have been here first.
However now youve got your breath you may tell us whats happened in
the town.

Ill whisper it said the Messenger putting his hands to his mouth
in the shape of a trumpet and stooping so as to get close to the Kings
ear. Alice was sorry for this as she wanted to hear the news too.
However instead of whispering he simply shouted at the top of his
voice Theyre at it again!

Do you call THAT a whisper? cried the poor King jumping up and
shaking himself. If you do such a thing again Ill have you buttered!
It went through and through my head like an earthquake!

It would have to be a very tiny earthquake! thought Alice. Who are at
it again? she ventured to ask.

Why the Lion and the Unicorn of course said the King.

Fighting for the crown?

Yes to be sure said the King: and the best of the joke is that
its MY crown all the while! Lets run and see them. And they trotted
off Alice repeating to herself as she ran the words of the old
song:--


   The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown:
   The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town.
   Some gave them white bread some gave them brown;
   Some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.


Does--the one--that wins--get the crown? she asked as well as she
could for the run was putting her quite out of breath.

Dear me no! said the King. What an idea!

Would you--be good enough Alice panted out after running a little
further to stop a minute--just to get--ones breath again?

Im GOOD enough the King said only Im not strong enough. You see
a minute goes by so fearfully quick. You might as well try to stop a
Bandersnatch!

Alice had no more breath for talking so they trotted on in silence
till they came in sight of a great crowd in the middle of which the
Lion and Unicorn were fighting. They were in such a cloud of dust that
at first Alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed
to distinguish the Unicorn by his horn.

They placed themselves close to where Hatta the other messenger was
standing watching the fight with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece
of bread-and-butter in the other.

Hes only just out of prison and he hadnt finished his tea when
he was sent in Haigha whispered to Alice: and they only give them
oyster-shells in there--so you see hes very hungry and thirsty. How
are you dear child? he went on putting his arm affectionately round
Hattas neck.

Hatta looked round and nodded and went on with his bread and butter.

Were you happy in prison dear child? said Haigha.

Hatta looked round once more and this time a tear or two trickled down
his cheek: but not a word would he say.

Speak cant you! Haigha cried impatiently. But Hatta only munched
away and drank some more tea.

Speak wont you! cried the King. How are they getting on with the
fight?

Hatta made a desperate effort and swallowed a large piece of
bread-and-butter. Theyre getting on very well he said in a choking
voice: each of them has been down about eighty-seven times.

Then I suppose theyll soon bring the white bread and the brown? Alice
ventured to remark.

Its waiting for em now said Hatta: this is a bit of it as Im
eating.

There was a pause in the fight just then and the Lion and the Unicorn
sat down panting while the King called out Ten minutes allowed for
refreshments! Haigha and Hatta set to work at once carrying rough
trays of white and brown bread. Alice took a piece to taste but it was
VERY dry.

I dont think theyll fight any more to-day the King said to Hatta:
go and order the drums to begin. And Hatta went bounding away like a
grasshopper.

For a minute or two Alice stood silent watching him. Suddenly she
brightened up. Look look! she cried pointing eagerly. Theres the
White Queen running across the country! She came flying out of the wood
over yonder--How fast those Queens CAN run!

Theres some enemy after her no doubt the King said without even
looking round. That woods full of them.

But arent you going to run and help her? Alice asked very much
surprised at his taking it so quietly.

No use no use! said the King. She runs so fearfully quick. You might
as well try to catch a Bandersnatch! But Ill make a memorandum about
her if you like--Shes a dear good creature he repeated softly to
himself as he opened his memorandum-book. Do you spell creature with
a double e?

At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them with his hands in his
pockets. I had the best of it this time? he said to the King just
glancing at him as he passed.

A little--a little the King replied rather nervously. You shouldnt
have run him through with your horn you know.

It didnt hurt him the Unicorn said carelessly and he was going
on when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round rather
instantly and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the
deepest disgust.

What--is--this? he said at last.

This is a child! Haigha replied eagerly coming in front of Alice
to introduce her and spreading out both his hands towards her in an
Anglo-Saxon attitude. We only found it to-day. Its as large as life
and twice as natural!

I always thought they were fabulous monsters! said the Unicorn. Is it
alive?

It can talk said Haigha solemnly.

The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice and said Talk child.

Alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: Do
you know I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters too! I never
saw one alive before!

Well now that we HAVE seen each other said the Unicorn if youll
believe in me Ill believe in you. Is that a bargain?

Yes if you like said Alice.

Come fetch out the plum-cake old man! the Unicorn went on turning
from her to the King. None of your brown bread for me!

Certainly--certainly! the King muttered and beckoned to Haigha. Open
the bag! he whispered. Quick! Not that one--thats full of hay!

Haigha took a large cake out of the bag and gave it to Alice to hold
while he got out a dish and carving-knife. How they all came out of it
Alice couldnt guess. It was just like a conjuring-trick she thought.

The Lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very
tired and sleepy and his eyes were half shut. Whats this! he said
blinking lazily at Alice and speaking in a deep hollow tone that
sounded like the tolling of a great bell.

Ah what IS it now? the Unicorn cried eagerly. Youll never guess!
_I_ couldnt.

The Lion looked at Alice wearily. Are you animal--vegetable--or
mineral? he said yawning at every other word.

Its a fabulous monster! the Unicorn cried out before Alice could
reply.

Then hand round the plum-cake Monster the Lion said lying down and
putting his chin on his paws. And sit down both of you (to the King
and the Unicorn): fair play with the cake you know!

The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between
the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him.

What a fight we might have for the crown NOW! the Unicorn said
looking slyly up at the crown which the poor King was nearly shaking
off his head he trembled so much.

I should win easy said the Lion.

Im not so sure of that said the Unicorn.

Why I beat you all round the town you chicken! the Lion replied
angrily half getting up as he spoke.

Here the King interrupted to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very
nervous and his voice quite quivered. All round the town? he
said. Thats a good long way. Did you go by the old bridge or the
market-place? You get the best view by the old bridge.

Im sure I dont know the Lion growled out as he lay down again.
There was too much dust to see anything. What a time the Monster is
cutting up that cake!

Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook with the great
dish on her knees and was sawing away diligently with the knife. Its
very provoking! she said in reply to the Lion (she was getting quite
used to being called the Monster). Ive cut several slices already
but they always join on again!

You dont know how to manage Looking-glass cakes the Unicorn
remarked. Hand it round first and cut it afterwards.

This sounded nonsense but Alice very obediently got up and carried the
dish round and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so.
NOW cut it up said the Lion as she returned to her place with the
empty dish.

I say this isnt fair! cried the Unicorn as Alice sat with the knife
in her hand very much puzzled how to begin. The Monster has given the
Lion twice as much as me!

Shes kept none for herself anyhow said the Lion. Do you like
plum-cake Monster?

But before Alice could answer him the drums began.

Where the noise came from she couldnt make out: the air seemed full
of it and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite
deafened. She started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in
her terror

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

and had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet
with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast before she dropped
to her knees and put her hands over her ears vainly trying to shut out
the dreadful uproar.

If THAT doesnt drum them out of town she thought to herself
nothing ever will!




CHAPTER VIII. Its my own Invention

After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away till all was dead
silence and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm. There was no one
to be seen and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming
about the Lion and the Unicorn and those queer Anglo-Saxon Messengers.
However there was the great dish still lying at her feet on which she
had tried to cut the plum-cake So I wasnt dreaming after all she
said to herself unless--unless were all part of the same dream. Only
I do hope its MY dream and not the Red Kings! I dont like belonging
to another persons dream she went on in a rather complaining tone:
Ive a great mind to go and wake him and see what happens!

At this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of
Ahoy! Ahoy! Check! and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came
galloping down upon her brandishing a great club. Just as he reached
her the horse stopped suddenly: Youre my prisoner! the Knight cried
as he tumbled off his horse.

Startled as she was Alice was more frightened for him than for herself
at the moment and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again.
As soon as he was comfortably in the saddle he began once more Youre
my-- but here another voice broke in Ahoy! Ahoy! Check! and Alice
looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.

This time it was a White Knight. He drew up at Alices side and tumbled
off his horse just as the Red Knight had done: then he got on again
and the two Knights sat and looked at each other for some time without
speaking. Alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment.

Shes MY prisoner you know! the Red Knight said at last.

Yes but then _I_ came and rescued her! the White Knight replied.

Well we must fight for her then said the Red Knight as he took up
his helmet (which hung from the saddle and was something the shape of a
horses head) and put it on.

You will observe the Rules of Battle of course? the White Knight
remarked putting on his helmet too.

I always do said the Red Knight and they began banging away at each
other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be out of the way
of the blows.

I wonder now what the Rules of Battle are she said to herself as
she watched the fight timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: one
Rule seems to be that if one Knight hits the other he knocks him off
his horse and if he misses he tumbles off himself--and another Rule
seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms as if they were
Punch and Judy--What a noise they make when they tumble! Just like
a whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender! And how quiet the
horses are! They let them get on and off them just as if they were
tables!

Another Rule of Battle that Alice had not noticed seemed to be that
they always fell on their heads and the battle ended with their both
falling off in this way side by side: when they got up again they
shook hands and then the Red Knight mounted and galloped off.

It was a glorious victory wasnt it? said the White Knight as he
came up panting.

I dont know Alice said doubtfully. I dont want to be anybodys
prisoner. I want to be a Queen.

So you will when youve crossed the next brook said the White
Knight. Ill see you safe to the end of the wood--and then I must go
back you know. Thats the end of my move.

Thank you very much said Alice. May I help you off with your
helmet? It was evidently more than he could manage by himself; however
she managed to shake him out of it at last.

Now one can breathe more easily said the Knight putting back his
shaggy hair with both hands and turning his gentle face and large mild
eyes to Alice. She thought she had never seen such a strange-looking
soldier in all her life.

He was dressed in tin armour which seemed to fit him very badly and
he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder
upside-down and with the lid hanging open. Alice looked at it with
great curiosity.

I see youre admiring my little box. the Knight said in a friendly
tone. Its my own invention--to keep clothes and sandwiches in. You see
I carry it upside-down so that the rain cant get in.

But the things can get OUT Alice gently remarked. Do you know the
lids open?

I didnt know it the Knight said a shade of vexation passing over
his face. Then all the things must have fallen out! And the box is no
use without them. He unfastened it as he spoke and was just going to
throw it into the bushes when a sudden thought seemed to strike him
and he hung it carefully on a tree. Can you guess why I did that? he
said to Alice.

Alice shook her head.

In hopes some bees may make a nest in it--then I should get the honey.

But youve got a bee-hive--or something like one--fastened to the
saddle said Alice.

Yes its a very good bee-hive the Knight said in a discontented
tone one of the best kind. But not a single bee has come near it yet.
And the other thing is a mouse-trap. I suppose the mice keep the bees
out--or the bees keep the mice out I dont know which.

I was wondering what the mouse-trap was for said Alice. It isnt
very likely there would be any mice on the horses back.

Not very likely perhaps said the Knight: but if they DO come I
dont choose to have them running all about.

You see he went on after a pause its as well to be provided for
EVERYTHING. Thats the reason the horse has all those anklets round his
feet.

But what are they for? Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

To guard against the bites of sharks the Knight replied. Its an
invention of my own. And now help me on. Ill go with you to the end of
the wood--Whats the dish for?

Its meant for plum-cake said Alice.

Wed better take it with us the Knight said. Itll come in handy if
we find any plum-cake. Help me to get it into this bag.

This took a very long time to manage though Alice held the bag open
very carefully because the Knight was so VERY awkward in putting in
the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself
instead. Its rather a tight fit you see he said as they got it in
a last; There are so many candlesticks in the bag. And he hung it
to the saddle which was already loaded with bunches of carrots and
fire-irons and many other things.

I hope youve got your hair well fastened on? he continued as they
set off.

Only in the usual way Alice said smiling.

Thats hardly enough he said anxiously. You see the wind is so VERY
strong here. Its as strong as soup.

Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?
Alice enquired.

Not yet said the Knight. But Ive got a plan for keeping it from
FALLING off.

I should like to hear it very much.

First you take an upright stick said the Knight. Then you make your
hair creep up it like a fruit-tree. Now the reason hair falls off is
because it hangs DOWN--things never fall UPWARDS you know. Its a plan
of my own invention. You may try it if you like.

It didnt sound a comfortable plan Alice thought and for a few minutes
she walked on in silence puzzling over the idea and every now and then
stopping to help the poor Knight who certainly was NOT a good rider.

Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often) he fell off in
front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather
suddenly) he fell off behind. Otherwise he kept on pretty well except
that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he
generally did this on the side on which Alice was walking she soon
found that it was the best plan not to walk QUITE close to the horse.

Im afraid youve not had much practice in riding she ventured to
say as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble.

The Knight looked very much surprised and a little offended at the
remark. What makes you say that? he asked as he scrambled back into
the saddle keeping hold of Alices hair with one hand to save himself
from falling over on the other side.

Because people dont fall off quite so often when theyve had much
practice.

Ive had plenty of practice the Knight said very gravely: plenty of
practice!

Alice could think of nothing better to say than Indeed? but she said
it as heartily as she could. They went on a little way in silence after
this the Knight with his eyes shut muttering to himself and Alice
watching anxiously for the next tumble.

The great art of riding the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice
waving his right arm as he spoke is to keep-- Here the sentence ended
as suddenly as it had begun as the Knight fell heavily on the top of
his head exactly in the path where Alice was walking. She was quite
frightened this time and said in an anxious tone as she picked him up
I hope no bones are broken?

None to speak of the Knight said as if he didnt mind breaking two
or three of them. The great art of riding as I was saying is--to keep
your balance properly. Like this you know--

He let go the bridle and stretched out both his arms to show Alice
what he meant and this time he fell flat on his back right under the
horses feet.

Plenty of practice! he went on repeating all the time that Alice was
getting him on his feet again. Plenty of practice!

Its too ridiculous! cried Alice losing all her patience this time.
You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels that you ought!

Does that kind go smoothly? the Knight asked in a tone of great
interest clasping his arms round the horses neck as he spoke just in
time to save himself from tumbling off again.

Much more smoothly than a live horse Alice said with a little scream
of laughter in spite of all she could do to prevent it.

Ill get one the Knight said thoughtfully to himself. One or
two--several.

There was a short silence after this and then the Knight went on again.
Im a great hand at inventing things. Now I daresay you noticed that
last time you picked me up that I was looking rather thoughtful?

You WERE a little grave said Alice.

Well just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate--would
you like to hear it?

Very much indeed Alice said politely.

Ill tell you how I came to think of it said the Knight. You see I
said to myself The only difficulty is with the feet: the HEAD is high
enough already. Now first I put my head on the top of the gate--then I
stand on my head--then the feet are high enough you see--then Im over
you see.

Yes I suppose youd be over when that was done Alice said
thoughtfully: but dont you think it would be rather hard?

I havent tried it yet the Knight said gravely: so I cant tell for
certain--but Im afraid it WOULD be a little hard.

He looked so vexed at the idea that Alice changed the subject hastily.
What a curious helmet youve got! she said cheerfully. Is that your
invention too?

The Knight looked down proudly at his helmet which hung from the
saddle. Yes he said but Ive invented a better one than that--like
a sugar loaf. When I used to wear it if I fell off the horse it always
touched the ground directly. So I had a VERY little way to fall you
see--But there WAS the danger of falling INTO it to be sure. That
happened to me once--and the worst of it was before I could get out
again the other White Knight came and put it on. He thought it was his
own helmet.

The knight looked so solemn about it that Alice did not dare to laugh.
Im afraid you must have hurt him she said in a trembling voice
being on the top of his head.

I had to kick him of course the Knight said very seriously. And
then he took the helmet off again--but it took hours and hours to get me
out. I was as fast as--as lightning you know.

But thats a different kind of fastness Alice objected.

The Knight shook his head. It was all kinds of fastness with me I can
assure you! he said. He raised his hands in some excitement as he said
this and instantly rolled out of the saddle and fell headlong into a
deep ditch.

Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. She was rather
startled by the fall as for some time he had kept on very well and she
was afraid that he really WAS hurt this time. However though she could
see nothing but the soles of his feet she was much relieved to hear
that he was talking on in his usual tone. All kinds of fastness
he repeated: but it was careless of him to put another mans helmet
on--with the man in it too.

How CAN you go on talking so quietly head downwards? Alice asked as
she dragged him out by the feet and laid him in a heap on the bank.

The Knight looked surprised at the question. What does it matter where
my body happens to be? he said. My mind goes on working all the same.
In fact the more head downwards I am the more I keep inventing new
things.

Now the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did he went on after
a pause was inventing a new pudding during the meat-course.

In time to have it cooked for the next course? said Alice. Well
not the NEXT course the Knight said in a slow thoughtful tone: no
certainly not the next COURSE.

Then it would have to be the next day. I suppose you wouldnt have two
pudding-courses in one dinner?

Well not the NEXT day the Knight repeated as before: not the next
DAY. In fact he went on holding his head down and his voice getting
lower and lower I dont believe that pudding ever WAS cooked! In fact
I dont believe that pudding ever WILL be cooked! And yet it was a very
clever pudding to invent.

What did you mean it to be made of? Alice asked hoping to cheer him
up for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it.

It began with blotting paper the Knight answered with a groan.

That wouldnt be very nice Im afraid--

Not very nice ALONE he interrupted quite eagerly: but youve no
idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other things--such as
gunpowder and sealing-wax. And here I must leave you. They had just
come to the end of the wood.

Alice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding.

You are sad the Knight said in an anxious tone: let me sing you a
song to comfort you.

Is it very long? Alice asked for she had heard a good deal of poetry
that day.

Its long said the Knight but very VERY beautiful. Everybody that
hears me sing it--either it brings the TEARS into their eyes or else--

Or else what? said Alice for the Knight had made a sudden pause.

Or else it doesnt you know. The name of the song is called HADDOCKS
EYES.

Oh thats the name of the song is it? Alice said trying to feel
interested.

No you dont understand the Knight said looking a little vexed.
Thats what the name is CALLED. The name really IS THE AGED AGED
MAN.

Then I ought to have said Thats what the SONG is called? Alice
corrected herself.

No you oughtnt: thats quite another thing! The SONG is called WAYS
AND MEANS: but thats only what its CALLED you know!

Well what IS the song then? said Alice who was by this time
completely bewildered.

I was coming to that the Knight said. The song really IS A-SITTING
ON A GATE: and the tunes my own invention.

So saying he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck:
then slowly beating time with one hand and with a faint smile lighting
up his gentle foolish face as if he enjoyed the music of his song he
began.

Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The
Looking-Glass this was the one that she always remembered most clearly.
Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again as if it
had been only yesterday--the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the
Knight--the setting sun gleaming through his hair and shining on his
armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her--the horse quietly
moving about with the reins hanging loose on his neck cropping the
grass at her feet--and the black shadows of the forest behind--all this
she took in like a picture as with one hand shading her eyes she
leant against a tree watching the strange pair and listening in a
half dream to the melancholy music of the song.

But the tune ISNT his own invention she said to herself: its I
GIVE THEE ALL I CAN NO MORE. She stood and listened very attentively
but no tears came into her eyes.


     Ill tell thee everything I can;
      Theres little to relate.
     I saw an aged aged man
      A-sitting on a gate.
     Who are you aged man? I said
      and how is it you live?
      And his answer trickled through my head
      Like water through a sieve.

     He said I look for butterflies
      That sleep among the wheat:
     I make them into mutton-pies
      And sell them in the street.
     I sell them unto men he said
      Who sail on stormy seas;
     And thats the way I get my bread--
      A trifle if you please.

     But I was thinking of a plan
      To dye ones whiskers green
     And always use so large a fan
      That they could not be seen.
     So having no reply to give
      To what the old man said
     I cried Come tell me how you live!
       And thumped him on the head.

     His accents mild took up the tale:
      He said I go my ways
     And when I find a mountain-rill
      I set it in a blaze;
     And thence they make a stuff they call
      Rolands Macassar Oil--
     Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
      They give me for my toil.

     But I was thinking of a way
      To feed oneself on batter
     And so go on from day to day
      Getting a little fatter.
     I shook him well from side to side
      Until his face was blue:
     Come tell me how you live I cried
      And what it is you do!

     He said I hunt for haddocks eyes
      Among the heather bright
     And work them into waistcoat-buttons
      In the silent night.
     And these I do not sell for gold
      Or coin of silvery shine
     But for a copper halfpenny
      And that will purchase nine.

     I sometimes dig for buttered rolls
      Or set limed twigs for crabs;
     I sometimes search the grassy knolls
      For wheels of Hansom-cabs.
     And thats the way (he gave a wink)
      By which I get my wealth--
     And very gladly will I drink
      Your Honours noble health.

     I heard him then for I had just
      Completed my design
     To keep the Menai bridge from rust
      By boiling it in wine.
     I thanked him much for telling me
      The way he got his wealth
     But chiefly for his wish that he
      Might drink my noble health.

     And now if eer by chance I put
      My fingers into glue
     Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
      Into a left-hand shoe
     Or if I drop upon my toe
      A very heavy weight
     I weep for it reminds me so
      Of that old man I used to know--

     Whose look was mild whose speech was slow
     Whose hair was whiter than the snow
     Whose face was very like a crow
     With eyes like cinders all aglow
     Who seemed distracted with his woe
     Who rocked his body to and fro
     And muttered mumblingly and low
     As if his mouth were full of dough
     Who snorted like a buffalo--
     That summer evening long ago
      A-sitting on a gate.


As the Knight sang the last words of the ballad he gathered up the
reins and turned his horses head along the road by which they had
come. Youve only a few yards to go he said down the hill and over
that little brook and then youll be a Queen--But youll stay and
see me off first? he added as Alice turned with an eager look in the
direction to which he pointed. I shant be long. Youll wait and wave
your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road? I think itll
encourage me you see.

Of course Ill wait said Alice: and thank you very much for coming
so far--and for the song--I liked it very much.

I hope so the Knight said doubtfully: but you didnt cry so much as
I thought you would.

So they shook hands and then the Knight rode slowly away into the
forest. It wont take long to see him OFF I expect Alice said to
herself as she stood watching him. There he goes! Right on his head as
usual! However he gets on again pretty easily--that comes of having so
many things hung round the horse-- So she went on talking to herself
as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road and the
Knight tumbling off first on one side and then on the other. After
the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn and then she waved her
handkerchief to him and waited till he was out of sight.

I hope it encouraged him she said as she turned to run down the
hill: and now for the last brook and to be a Queen! How grand it
sounds! A very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook. The
Eighth Square at last! she cried as she bounded across

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

and threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss with little
flower-beds dotted about it here and there. Oh how glad I am to get
here! And what IS this on my head? she exclaimed in a tone of dismay
as she put her hands up to something very heavy and fitted tight all
round her head.

But how CAN it have got there without my knowing it? she said to
herself as she lifted it off and set it on her lap to make out what it
could possibly be.

It was a golden crown.




CHAPTER IX. Queen Alice

Well this IS grand! said Alice. I never expected I should be a Queen
so soon--and Ill tell you what it is your majesty she went on in
a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself) itll
never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that! Queens have
to be dignified you know!

So she got up and walked about--rather stiffly just at first as she was
afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the
thought that there was nobody to see her and if I really am a Queen
she said as she sat down again I shall be able to manage it quite well
in time.

Everything was happening so oddly that she didnt feel a bit surprised
at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her one
on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came
there but she feared it would not be quite civil. However there would
be no harm she thought in asking if the game was over. Please would
you tell me-- she began looking timidly at the Red Queen.

Speak when youre spoken to! The Queen sharply interrupted her.

But if everybody obeyed that rule said Alice who was always ready
for a little argument and if you only spoke when you were spoken to
and the other person always waited for YOU to begin you see nobody
would ever say anything so that--

Ridiculous! cried the Queen. Why dont you see child-- here she
broke off with a frown and after thinking for a minute suddenly
changed the subject of the conversation. What do you mean by If you
really are a Queen? What right have you to call yourself so? You cant
be a Queen you know till youve passed the proper examination. And the
sooner we begin it the better.

I only said if! poor Alice pleaded in a piteous tone.

The two Queens looked at each other and the Red Queen remarked with a
little shudder She SAYS she only said if--

But she said a great deal more than that! the White Queen moaned
wringing her hands. Oh ever so much more than that!

So you did you know the Red Queen said to Alice. Always speak the
truth--think before you speak--and write it down afterwards.

Im sure I didnt mean-- Alice was beginning but the Red Queen
interrupted her impatiently.

Thats just what I complain of! You SHOULD have meant! What do you
suppose is the use of child without any meaning? Even a joke should
have some meaning--and a childs more important than a joke I hope. You
couldnt deny that even if you tried with both hands.

I dont deny things with my HANDS Alice objected.

Nobody said you did said the Red Queen. I said you couldnt if you
tried.

Shes in that state of mind said the White Queen that she wants to
deny SOMETHING--only she doesnt know what to deny!

A nasty vicious temper the Red Queen remarked; and then there was an
uncomfortable silence for a minute or two.

The Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen I invite
you to Alices dinner-party this afternoon.

The White Queen smiled feebly and said And I invite YOU.

I didnt know I was to have a party at all said Alice; but if there
is to be one I think _I_ ought to invite the guests.

We gave you the opportunity of doing it the Red Queen remarked: but
I daresay youve not had many lessons in manners yet?

Manners are not taught in lessons said Alice. Lessons teach you to
do sums and things of that sort.

And you do Addition? the White Queen asked. Whats one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?

I dont know said Alice. I lost count.

She cant do Addition the Red Queen interrupted. Can you do
Subtraction? Take nine from eight.

Nine from eight I cant you know Alice replied very readily: but--

She cant do Subtraction said the White Queen. Can you do Division?
Divide a loaf by a knife--whats the answer to that?

I suppose-- Alice was beginning but the Red Queen answered for her.
Bread-and-butter of course. Try another Subtraction sum. Take a bone
from a dog: what remains?

Alice considered. The bone wouldnt remain of course if I took
it--and the dog wouldnt remain; it would come to bite me--and Im sure
I shouldnt remain!

Then you think nothing would remain? said the Red Queen.

I think thats the answer.

Wrong as usual said the Red Queen: the dogs temper would remain.

But I dont see how--

Why look here! the Red Queen cried. The dog would lose its temper
wouldnt it?

Perhaps it would Alice replied cautiously.

Then if the dog went away its temper would remain! the Queen
exclaimed triumphantly.

Alice said as gravely as she could They might go different ways. But
she couldnt help thinking to herself What dreadful nonsense we ARE
talking!

She cant do sums a BIT! the Queens said together with great
emphasis.

Can YOU do sums? Alice said turning suddenly on the White Queen for
she didnt like being found fault with so much.

The Queen gasped and shut her eyes. I can do Addition if you give me
time--but I cant do Subtraction under ANY circumstances!

Of course you know your A B C? said the Red Queen.

To be sure I do. said Alice.

So do I the White Queen whispered: well often say it over together
dear. And Ill tell you a secret--I can read words of one letter! Isnt
THAT grand! However dont be discouraged. Youll come to it in time.

Here the Red Queen began again. Can you answer useful questions? she
said. How is bread made?

I know THAT! Alice cried eagerly. You take some flour--

Where do you pick the flower? the White Queen asked. In a garden or
in the hedges?

Well it isnt PICKED at all Alice explained: its GROUND--

How many acres of ground? said the White Queen. You mustnt leave out
so many things.

Fan her head! the Red Queen anxiously interrupted. Shell be feverish
after so much thinking. So they set to work and fanned her with bunches
of leaves till she had to beg them to leave off it blew her hair about
so.

Shes all right again now said the Red Queen. Do you know Languages?
Whats the French for fiddle-de-dee?

Fiddle-de-dees not English Alice replied gravely.

Who ever said it was? said the Red Queen.

Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. If youll
tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is Ill tell you the French for
it! she exclaimed triumphantly.

But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly and said Queens never
make bargains.

I wish Queens never asked questions Alice thought to herself.

Dont let us quarrel the White Queen said in an anxious tone. What
is the cause of lightning?

The cause of lightning Alice said very decidedly for she felt quite
certain about this is the thunder--no no! she hastily corrected
herself. I meant the other way.

Its too late to correct it said the Red Queen: when youve once
said a thing that fixes it and you must take the consequences.

Which reminds me-- the White Queen said looking down and nervously
clasping and unclasping her hands we had SUCH a thunderstorm last
Tuesday--I mean one of the last set of Tuesdays you know.

Alice was puzzled. In OUR country she remarked theres only one day
at a time.

The Red Queen said Thats a poor thin way of doing things. Now HERE
we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time and sometimes
in the winter we take as many as five nights together--for warmth you
know.

Are five nights warmer than one night then? Alice ventured to ask.

Five times as warm of course.

But they should be five times as COLD by the same rule--

Just so! cried the Red Queen. Five times as warm AND five times
as cold--just as Im five times as rich as you are AND five times as
clever!

Alice sighed and gave it up. Its exactly like a riddle with no
answer! she thought.

Humpty Dumpty saw it too the White Queen went on in a low voice more
as if she were talking to herself. He came to the door with a corkscrew
in his hand--

What did he want? said the Red Queen.

He said he WOULD come in the White Queen went on because he was
looking for a hippopotamus. Now as it happened there wasnt such a
thing in the house that morning.

Is there generally? Alice asked in an astonished tone.

Well only on Thursdays said the Queen.

I know what he came for said Alice: he wanted to punish the fish
because--

Here the White Queen began again. It was SUCH a thunderstorm you cant
think! (She NEVER could you know said the Red Queen.) And part of
the roof came off and ever so much thunder got in--and it went
rolling round the room in great lumps--and knocking over the tables and
things--till I was so frightened I couldnt remember my own name!

Alice thought to herself I never should TRY to remember my name in the
middle of an accident! Where would be the use of it? but she did not
say this aloud for fear of hurting the poor Queens feeling.

Your Majesty must excuse her the Red Queen said to Alice taking
one of the White Queens hands in her own and gently stroking it:
she means well but she cant help saying foolish things as a general
rule.

The White Queen looked timidly at Alice who felt she OUGHT to say
something kind but really couldnt think of anything at the moment.

She never was really well brought up the Red Queen went on: but
its amazing how good-tempered she is! Pat her on the head and see how
pleased shell be! But this was more than Alice had courage to do.

A little kindness--and putting her hair in papers--would do wonders
with her--

The White Queen gave a deep sigh and laid her head on Alices shoulder.
I AM so sleepy? she moaned.

Shes tired poor thing! said the Red Queen. Smooth her hair--lend
her your nightcap--and sing her a soothing lullaby.

I havent got a nightcap with me said Alice as she tried to obey the
first direction: and I dont know any soothing lullabies.

I must do it myself then said the Red Queen and she began:


   Hush-a-by lady in Alices lap!
   Till the feasts ready weve time for a nap:
   When the feasts over well go to the ball--
   Red Queen and White Queen and Alice and all!


And now you know the words she added as she put her head down on
Alices other shoulder just sing it through to ME. Im getting sleepy
too. In another moment both Queens were fast asleep and snoring loud.

What AM I to do? exclaimed Alice looking about in great perplexity
as first one round head and then the other rolled down from her
shoulder and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. I dont think it EVER
happened before that any one had to take care of two Queens asleep
at once! No not in all the History of England--it couldnt you know
because there never was more than one Queen at a time. Do wake up you
heavy things! she went on in an impatient tone; but there was no answer
but a gentle snoring.

The snoring got more distinct every minute and sounded more like a
tune: at last she could even make out the words and she listened so
eagerly that when the two great heads vanished from her lap she hardly
missed them.

She was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words
QUEEN ALICE in large letters and on each side of the arch there was a
bell-handle; one was marked Visitors Bell and the other Servants
Bell.

Ill wait till the songs over thought Alice and then Ill
ring--the--WHICH bell must I ring? she went on very much puzzled by
the names. Im not a visitor and Im not a servant. There OUGHT to be
one marked Queen you know--

Just then the door opened a little way and a creature with a long beak
put its head out for a moment and said No admittance till the week
after next! and shut the door again with a bang.

Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time but at last a very old
Frog who was sitting under a tree got up and hobbled slowly towards
her: he was dressed in bright yellow and had enormous boots on.

What is it now? the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.

Alice turned round ready to find fault with anybody. Wheres the
servant whose business it is to answer the door? she began angrily.

Which door? said the Frog.

Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he
spoke. THIS door of course!

The Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute:
then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb as if he were trying
whether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice.

To answer the door? he said. Whats it been asking of? He was so
hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him.

I dont know what you mean she said.

I talks English doesnt I? the Frog went on. Or are you deaf? What
did it ask you?

Nothing! Alice said impatiently. Ive been knocking at it!

Shouldnt do that--shouldnt do that-- the Frog muttered. Vexes it
you know. Then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his
great feet. You let IT alone he panted out as he hobbled back to his
tree and itll let YOU alone you know.

At this moment the door was flung open and a shrill voice was heard
singing:


   To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said
   Ive a sceptre in hand Ive a crown on my head;
   Let the Looking-Glass creatures whatever they be
   Come and dine with the Red Queen the White Queen and me.


And hundreds of voices joined in the chorus:


  Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can
  And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:
  Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea--
  And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!


Then followed a confused noise of cheering and Alice thought to
herself Thirty times three makes ninety. I wonder if any ones
counting? In a minute there was silence again and the same shrill
voice sang another verse;


  O Looking-Glass creatures quoth Alice draw near!
  Tis an honour to see me a favour to hear:
  Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea
  Along with the Red Queen the White Queen and me!


Then came the chorus again:--


  Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink
  Or anything else that is pleasant to drink:
  Mix sand with the cider and wool with the wine--
  And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine!


Ninety times nine! Alice repeated in despair Oh thatll never
be done! Id better go in at once-- and there was a dead silence the
moment she appeared.

Alice glanced nervously along the table as she walked up the large
hall and noticed that there were about fifty guests of all kinds: some
were animals some birds and there were even a few flowers among them.
Im glad theyve come without waiting to be asked she thought: I
should never have known who were the right people to invite!

There were three chairs at the head of the table; the Red and White
Queens had already taken two of them but the middle one was empty.
Alice sat down in it rather uncomfortable in the silence and longing
for some one to speak.

At last the Red Queen began. Youve missed the soup and fish she
said. Put on the joint! And the waiters set a leg of mutton before
Alice who looked at it rather anxiously as she had never had to carve
a joint before.

You look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton
said the Red Queen. Alice--Mutton; Mutton--Alice. The leg of mutton
got up in the dish and made a little bow to Alice; and Alice returned
the bow not knowing whether to be frightened or amused.

May I give you a slice? she said taking up the knife and fork and
looking from one Queen to the other.

Certainly not the Red Queen said very decidedly: it isnt etiquette
to cut any one youve been introduced to. Remove the joint! And the
waiters carried it off and brought a large plum-pudding in its place.

I wont be introduced to the pudding please Alice said rather
hastily or we shall get no dinner at all. May I give you some?

But the Red Queen looked sulky and growled Pudding--Alice;
Alice--Pudding. Remove the pudding! and the waiters took it away so
quickly that Alice couldnt return its bow.

However she didnt see why the Red Queen should be the only one to give
orders so as an experiment she called out Waiter! Bring back the
pudding! and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. It
was so large that she couldnt help feeling a LITTLE shy with it as she
had been with the mutton; however she conquered her shyness by a great
effort and cut a slice and handed it to the Red Queen.

What impertinence! said the Pudding. I wonder how youd like it if I
were to cut a slice out of YOU you creature!

It spoke in a thick suety sort of voice and Alice hadnt a word to say
in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp.

Make a remark said the Red Queen: its ridiculous to leave all the
conversation to the pudding!

Do you know Ive had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to-day
Alice began a little frightened at finding that the moment she opened
her lips there was dead silence and all eyes were fixed upon her; and
its a very curious thing I think--every poem was about fishes in some
way. Do you know why theyre so fond of fishes all about here?

She spoke to the Red Queen whose answer was a little wide of the mark.
As to fishes she said very slowly and solemnly putting her mouth
close to Alices ear her White Majesty knows a lovely riddle--all in
poetry--all about fishes. Shall she repeat it?

Her Red Majestys very kind to mention it the White Queen murmured
into Alices other ear in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. It
would be SUCH a treat! May I?

Please do Alice said very politely.

The White Queen laughed with delight and stroked Alices cheek. Then
she began:


    First the fish must be caught.
   That is easy: a baby I think could have caught it.
    Next the fish must be bought.
   That is easy: a penny I think would have bought it.

    Now cook me the fish!
   That is easy and will not take more than a minute.
    Let it lie in a dish!
   That is easy because it already is in it.

    Bring it here! Let me sup!
   It is easy to set such a dish on the table.
    Take the dish-cover up!
   Ah THAT is so hard that I fear Im unable!

    For it holds it like glue--
  Holds the lid to the dish while it lies in the middle:
    Which is easiest to do
  Un-dish-cover the fish or dishcover the riddle?


Take a minute to think about it and then guess said the Red Queen.
Meanwhile well drink your health--Queen Alices health! she screamed
at the top of her voice and all the guests began drinking it directly
and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon
their heads like extinguishers and drank all that trickled down their
faces--others upset the decanters and drank the wine as it ran off
the edges of the table--and three of them (who looked like kangaroos)
scrambled into the dish of roast mutton and began eagerly lapping up
the gravy just like pigs in a trough! thought Alice.

You ought to return thanks in a neat speech the Red Queen said
frowning at Alice as she spoke.

We must support you you know the White Queen whispered as Alice got
up to do it very obediently but a little frightened.

Thank you very much she whispered in reply but I can do quite well
without.

That wouldnt be at all the thing the Red Queen said very decidedly:
so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace.

(And they DID push so! she said afterwards when she was telling her
sister the history of the feast. You would have thought they wanted to
squeeze me flat!)

In fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she
made her speech: the two Queens pushed her so one on each side that
they nearly lifted her up into the air: I rise to return thanks--
Alice began: and she really DID rise as she spoke several inches; but
she got hold of the edge of the table and managed to pull herself down
again.

Take care of yourself! screamed the White Queen seizing Alices hair
with both her hands. Somethings going to happen!

And then (as Alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened
in a moment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling looking something
like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. As to the bottles they
each took a pair of plates which they hastily fitted on as wings and
so with forks for legs went fluttering about in all directions: and
very like birds they look Alice thought to herself as well as she
could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.

At this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side and turned to see
what was the matter with the White Queen; but instead of the Queen
there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. Here I am! cried a
voice from the soup tureen and Alice turned again just in time to see
the Queens broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over
the edge of the tureen before she disappeared into the soup.

There was not a moment to be lost. Already several of the guests were
lying down in the dishes and the soup ladle was walking up the table
towards Alices chair and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of
its way.

I cant stand this any longer! she cried as she jumped up and seized
the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull and plates dishes
guests and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor.

And as for YOU she went on turning fiercely upon the Red Queen whom
she considered as the cause of all the mischief--but the Queen was no
longer at her side--she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a
little doll and was now on the table merrily running round and round
after her own shawl which was trailing behind her.

At any other time Alice would have felt surprised at this but she was
far too much excited to be surprised at anything NOW. As for YOU
she repeated catching hold of the little creature in the very act of
jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table Ill shake
you into a kitten that I will!




CHAPTER X. Shaking

She took her off the table as she spoke and shook her backwards and
forwards with all her might.

The Red Queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very
small and her eyes got large and green: and still as Alice went on
shaking her she kept on growing shorter--and fatter--and softer--and
rounder--and--




CHAPTER XI. Waking

--and it really WAS a kitten after all.




CHAPTER XII. Which Dreamed it?

Your majesty shouldnt purr so loud Alice said rubbing her eyes and
addressing the kitten respectfully yet with some severity. You
woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And youve been along with me
Kitty--all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it dear?

It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the
remark) that whatever you say to them they ALWAYS purr. If they would
only purr for yes and mew for no or any rule of that sort she had
said so that one could keep up a conversation! But how CAN you talk
with a person if they always say the same thing?

On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess
whether it meant yes or no.

So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the
Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug and put
the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. Now Kitty! she cried
clapping her hands triumphantly. Confess that was what you turned
into!

(But it wouldnt look at it she said when she was explaining the
thing afterwards to her sister: it turned away its head and pretended
not to see it: but it looked a LITTLE ashamed of itself so I think it
MUST have been the Red Queen.)

Sit up a little more stiffly dear! Alice cried with a merry laugh.
And curtsey while youre thinking what to--what to purr. It saves time
remember! And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss just in
honour of having been a Red Queen.

Snowdrop my pet! she went on looking over her shoulder at the White
Kitten which was still patiently undergoing its toilet when WILL
Dinah have finished with your White Majesty I wonder? That must be the
reason you were so untidy in my dream--Dinah! do you know that youre
scrubbing a White Queen? Really its most disrespectful of you!

And what did DINAH turn to I wonder? she prattled on as she settled
comfortably down with one elbow in the rug and her chin in her hand
to watch the kittens. Tell me Dinah did you turn to Humpty Dumpty? I
THINK you did--however youd better not mention it to your friends just
yet for Im not sure.

By the way Kitty if only youd been really with me in my dream there
was one thing you WOULD have enjoyed--I had such a quantity of poetry
said to me all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a real
treat. All the time youre eating your breakfast Ill repeat The
Walrus and the Carpenter to you; and then you can make believe its
oysters dear!

Now Kitty lets consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is a
serious question my dear and you should NOT go on licking your paw
like that--as if Dinah hadnt washed you this morning! You see Kitty
it MUST have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream
of course--but then I was part of his dream too! WAS it the Red King
Kitty? You were his wife my dear so you ought to know--Oh Kitty DO
help to settle it! Im sure your paw can wait! But the provoking kitten
only began on the other paw and pretended it hadnt heard the question.

Which do YOU think it was?


              ----


         A boat beneath a sunny sky
         Lingering onward dreamily
         In an evening of July--

         Children three that nestle near
         Eager eye and willing ear
         Pleased a simple tale to hear--

         Long has paled that sunny sky:
         Echoes fade and memories die.
         Autumn frosts have slain July.

         Still she haunts me phantomwise
         Alice moving under skies
         Never seen by waking eyes.

         Children yet the tale to hear
         Eager eye and willing ear
         Lovingly shall nestle near.

         In a Wonderland they lie
         Dreaming as the days go by
         Dreaming as the summers die:

         Ever drifting down the stream--
         Lingering in the golden gleam--
         Life what is it but a dream?

                           The MAN who SAW
                             the FUTURE

                          By EDMOND HAMILTON


Jean de Marselait Inquisitor Extraordinary of the King of France
raised his head from the parchments that littered the crude desk at
which he sat. His glance shifted along the long stone-walled torchlit
room to the file of mail-clad soldiers who stood like steel statues by
its door. A word from him and two of them sprang forward.

You may bring in the prisoner he said.

The two disappeared through the door and in moments there came a clang
of opening bolts and grating of heavy hinges from somewhere in the
building. Then the clang of the returning soldiers and they entered the
room with another man between them whose hands were fettered.

[Illustration: Illustrated by MOREY]

He was a straight figure and was dressed in drab tunic and hose. His
dark hair was long and straight and his face held a dreaming strength
altogether different from the battered visages of the soldiers or the
changeless mask of the Inquisitor. The latter regarded the prisoner for
a moment and then lifted one of the parchments from before him and read
from it in a smooth clear voice.

Henri Lothiere apothecary's assistant of Paris he read is charged
in this year of our lord one thousand four hundred and forty-four with
offending against God and the king by committing the crime of sorcery.

The prisoner spoke for the first time his voice low but steady. I am
no sorcerer sire.

Jean de Marselait read calmly on from the parchment. It is stated by
many witnesses that for long that part of Paris called Nanley by some
has been troubled by works of the devil. Ever and anon great claps of
thunder have been heard issuing from an open field there without visible
cause. They were evidently caused by a sorcerer of power since even
exorcists could not halt them.

It is attested by many that the accused Henri Lothiere did in spite
of the known diabolical nature of the thing spend much time at the
field in question. It is also attested that the said Henri Lothiere did
state that in his opinion the thunderclaps were not of diabolical
origin and that if they were studied their cause might be discovered.

It being suspected from this that Henri Lothiere was himself the
sorcerer causing the thunderclaps he was watched and on the third day
of June was seen to go in the early morning to the unholy spot with
certain instruments. There he was observed going through strange and
diabolical conjurations when there came suddenly another thunderclap
and the said Henri Lothiere did vanish entirely from view in that
moment. This fact is attested beyond all doubt.

The news spreading many hundreds watched around the field during that
day. Upon that night before midnight another thunderclap was heard and
the said Henri Lothiere was seen by these hundreds to appear at the
field's center as swiftly and as strangely as he had vanished. The
fear-stricken hundreds around the field heard him tell them how by
diabolical power he had gone for hundreds of years into the future a
thing surely possible only to the devil and his minions and heard him
tell other blasphemies before they seized him and brought him to the
Inquisitor of the King praying that he be burned and his work of
sorcery thus halted.

Therefore Henri Lothiere since you were seen to vanish and to
reappear as only the servants of the evil one might do and were heard
by many to utter the blasphemies mentioned I must adjudge you a
sorcerer with the penalty of death by fire. If anything there be that
you can advance in palliation of your black offense however you may
now do so before final sentence is passed upon you.

Jean de Marselait laid down the parchment and raised his eyes to the
prisoner. The latter looked round him quickly for a moment a
half-glimpsed panic for an instant in his eyes then seemed to steady.

Sire I cannot change the sentence you will pass upon me he said
quietly yet do I wish well to relate once what happened to me and
what I saw. Is it permitted me to tell that from first to last?

The Inquisitor's head bent and Henri Lothiere spoke his voice gaining
in strength and fervor as he continued.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sire I Henri Lothiere am no sorcerer but a simple apothecary's
assistant. It was always my nature from earliest youth to desire to
delve into matters unknown to men; the secrets of the earth and sea and
sky the knowledge hidden from us. I knew well that this was wicked
that the Church teaches all we need to know and that heaven frowns when
we pry into its mysteries but so strong was my desire to know that
many times I concerned myself with matters forbidden.

I had sought to know the nature of the lightning and the manner of
flight of the birds and the way in which fishes are able to live
beneath the waters and the mystery of the stars. So when these
thunderclaps began to be heard in the part of Paris in which I lived I
did not fear them so much as my neighbors. I was eager to learn only
what was causing them for it seemed to me that their cause might be
learned.

So I began to go to that field from which they issued to study them. I
waited in it and twice I heard the great thunderclaps myself. I thought
they came from near the field's center and I studied that place. But I
could see nothing there that was causing them. I dug in the ground I
looked up for hours into the sky but there was nothing. And still at
intervals the thunderclaps sounded.

I still kept going to the field though I knew that many of my
neighbors whispered that I was engaged in sorcery. Upon that morning of
the third day of June it had occurred to me to take certain
instruments such as loadstones to the field to see whether anything
might be learned with them. I went a few superstitious ones following
me at a distance. I reached the field's center and started the
examinations I had planned. Then came suddenly another thunderclap and
with it I passed from the sight of those who had followed and were
watching vanished from view.

Sire I cannot well describe what happened in that moment. I heard the
thunderclap come as though from all the air around me stunning my ears
with its terrible burst of sound. And at the same moment that I heard
it I was buffeted as though by awful winds and seemed falling downward
through terrific depths. Then through the hellish uproar I felt myself
bumping upon a hard surface and the sounds quickly ceased from about
me.

I had involuntarily closed my eyes at the great thunderclap but now
slowly I opened them. I looked around me first in stupefaction and
then in growing amazement. For I was not in that familiar field at all
sire that I had been in a moment before. I was in a room lying upon
its floor and it was such a room as I had never seen before.

Its walls were smooth and white and gleaming. There were windows in the
walls and they were closed with sheets of glass so smooth and clear
that one seemed looking through a clear opening rather than through
glass. The floor was of stone smooth and seamless as though carven from
one great rock yet seeming not in some way to be stone at all. There
was a great circle of smooth metal inset in it and it was on it that I
was lying.

All around the room were many great things the like of which I had
never seen. Some seemed of black metal seemed contrivances or machines
of some sort. Black cords of wire connected them to each other and from
part of them came a humming sound that did not stop. Others had glass
tubes fixed on the front of them and there were square black plates on
which were many shining little handles and buttons.

There was a sound of voices and I turned to find that two men were
bending over me. They were men like myself yet they were at the same
time like no men I had ever met! One was white-bearded and the other
plump and bare of face. Neither of them wore cloak or tunic or hose.
Instead they wore loose and straight-hanging garments of cloth.

They were both greatly excited it seemed and were talking to each
other as they bent over me. I caught a word or two of their speech in a
moment and found it was French they were talking. But it was not the
French I knew being so strange and with so many new words as to be
almost a different language. I could understand the drift though of
what they were saying.

'We have succeeded!' the plump one was shouting excitedly. 'We've
brought someone through at last!'

'They will never believe it' the other replied. 'They'll say it was
faked.'

'Nonsense!' cried the first. 'We can do it again Rastin; we can show
them before their own eyes!'

They bent toward me seeing me staring at them.

'Where are you from?' shouted the plump-faced one. 'What time--what
year--what century?'

'He doesn't understand Thicourt' muttered the white-bearded one.
'What year is this now my friend?' he asked me.

I found voice to answer. 'Surely sirs whoever you be you know that
this is the year fourteen hundred and forty-four' I said.

That set them off again into a babble of excited talk of which I could
make out only a word here and there. They lifted me up seeing how sick
and weak I felt and seated me in a strange but very comfortable chair.
I felt dazed. The two were still talking excitedly but finally the
white-bearded one Rastin turned to me. He spoke to me very slowly so
that I understood him clearly and he asked me my name. I told him.

'Henri Lothiere' he repeated. 'Well Henri you must try to
understand. You are not now in the year 1444. You are five hundred years
in the future or what would seem to you the future. This is the year
1944.'

'And Rastin and I have jerked you out of your own time across five
solid centuries' said the other grinning.

I looked from one to the other. 'Messieurs' I pleaded and Rastin
shook his head.

'He does not believe' he said to the other. Then to me 'Where were
you just before you found yourself here Henri?' he asked.

'In a field at the outskirts of Paris' I said.

'Well look from that window and see if you still believe yourself in
your 15th-century Paris.'

       *       *       *       *       *

I went to the window. I looked out. Mother of God what a sight before
my eyes! The familiar gray little houses the open fields behind them
the saunterers in the dirt streets--all these were gone and it was a new
and terrible city that lay about me! Its broad streets were of stone and
great buildings of many levels rose on either side of them. Great
numbers of people dressed like the two beside me moved in the streets
and also strange vehicles or carriages undrawn by horse or ox that
rushed to and fro at undreamed-of speed! I staggered back to the chair.

'You believe now Henri?' asked the whitebeard Rastin kindly enough
and I nodded weakly. My brain was whirling.

He pointed to the circle of metal on the floor and the machines around
the room. 'Those are what we used to jerk you from your own time to this
one' he said.

'But how sirs?' I asked. 'For the love of God how is it that you can
take me from one time to another? Have ye become gods or devils?'

'Neither the one nor the other Henri' he answered. 'We are simply
scientists physicists--men who want to know as much as man can know and
who spend our lives in seeking knowledge.'

I felt my confidence returning. These were men such as I had dreamed
might some day be. 'But what can you do with time?' I asked. 'Is not
time a thing unalterable unchanging?'

Both shook their heads. 'No Henri it is not. But lately have our men
of science found that out.'

They went on to tell me of things that I could not understand. It
seemed they were telling that their men of knowledge had found time to
be a mere measurement or dimension just as length or breadth or
thickness. They mentioned names with reverence that I had never
heard--Einstein and De Sitter and Lorentz. I was in a maze at their
words.

They said that just as men use force to move or rotate matter from one
point along the three known measurements to another so might matter be
rotated from one point in time the fourth measurement to another if
the right force were used. They said that their machines produced that
force and applied it to the metal circle from five hundred years before
to this time of theirs.

They had tried it many times they said but nothing had been on the
spot at that time and they had rotated nothing but the air above it from
the one time to the other and the reverse. I told them of the
thunderclaps that had been heard at the spot in the field and that had
made me curious. They said that they had been caused by the changing of
the air above the spot from the one time to the other in their trials. I
could not understand these things.

They said then that I had happened to be on the spot when they had
again turned on their force and so had been rotated out of my own time
into theirs. They said that they had always hoped to get someone living
from a distant time in that way since such a man would be a proof to
all the other men of knowledge of what they had been able to do.

I could not comprehend and they saw and told me not to fear. I was not
fearful but excited at the things that I saw around me. I asked of
those things and Rastin and Thicourt laughed and explained some of them
to me as best they could. Much they said that I did not understand but
my eyes saw marvels in that room of which I had never dreamed.

They showed me a thing like a small glass bottle with wires inside and
then told me to touch a button beneath it. I did so and the bottle shone
with a brilliant light exceeding that of scores of candles. I shrank
back but they laughed and when Rastin touched the button again the
light in the glass thing vanished. I saw that there were many of these
things in the ceiling.

They showed me also a rounded black object of metal with a wheel at the
end. A belt ran around the wheel and around smaller wheels connected to
many machines. They touched a lever on this object and a sound of
humming came from it and the wheel turned very fast turning all the
machines with the belt. It turned faster than any man could ever have
turned it yet when they touched the lever again its turning ceased.
They said that it was the power of the lightning in the skies that they
used to make the light and to turn that wheel!

My brain reeled at the wonders that they showed. One took an instrument
from the table that he held to his face saying that he would summon the
other scientists or men of knowledge to see their experiment that night.
He spoke into the instrument as though to different men and let me hear
voices from it answering him! They said that the men who answered were
leagues separated from him!

I could not believe--and yet somehow I did believe! I was half-dazed
with wonder and yet excited too. The white-bearded man Rastin saw
that and encouraged me. Then they brought a small box with an opening
and placed a black disk on the box and set it turning in some way. A
woman's voice came from the opening of the box singing. I shuddered
when they told me that the woman was one who had died years before.
Could the dead speak thus?

       *       *       *       *       *

How can I describe what I saw there? Another box or cabinet there was
with an opening also. I thought it was like that from which I had heard
the dead woman singing but they said it was different. They touched
buttons on it and a voice came from it speaking in a tongue I knew not.
They said that the man was speaking thousands of leagues from us in a
strange land across the uncrossed western ocean yet he seemed speaking
by my side!

They saw how dazed I was by these things and gave me wine. At that I
took heart for wine at least was as it had always been.

'You will want to see Paris--the Paris of our time Henri?' asked
Rastin.

'But it is different--terrible--' I said.

'We'll take you' Thicourt said 'but first your clothes--'

He got a long light coat that they had me put on that covered my tunic
and hose and a hat of grotesque round shape that they put on my head.
They led me then out of the building and into the street.

I gazed astoundedly along that street. It had a raised walk at either
side on which many hundreds of people moved to and fro all dressed in
as strange a fashion. Many like Rastin and Thicourt seemed of gentle
blood yet in spite of this they did not wear a sword or even a
dagger. There were no knights or squires or priests or peasants. All
seemed dressed much the same.

Small lads ran to and fro selling what seemed sheets of very thin white
parchment many times folded and covered with lettering. Rastin said
that these had written in them all things that had happened through all
the world even but hours before. I said that to write even one of these
sheets would take a clerk many days but they said that the writing was
done in some way very quickly by machines.

In the broad stone street between the two raised walks were rushing
back and forth the strange vehicles I had seen from the window. There
was no animal pulling or pushing any one of them yet they never halted
their swift rush and carried many people at unthinkable speed.
Sometimes those who walked stepped before the rushing vehicles and then
from them came terrible warning snarls or moans that made the walkers
draw back.

One of the vehicles stood at the walk's edge before us and we entered
it and sat side by side on a soft leather seat. Thicourt sat behind a
wheel on a post with levers beside him. He touched these and a humming
sound came from somewhere in the vehicle and then it too began to rush
forward. Faster and faster along the street it went yet neither of them
seemed afraid.

Many thousands of these vehicles were moving swiftly through the
streets about us. We passed on between great buildings and along wider
streets my eyes and ears numbed by what I saw about me. Then the
buildings grew smaller after we had gone for miles through them and
we were passing through the city's outskirts. I could not believe
hardly that it was Paris in which I was.

We came to a great flat and open field outside the city and there
Thicourt stopped and we got out of the vehicle. There were big buildings
at the field's end and I saw other vehicles rolling out of them across
the field ones different from any I had yet seen with flat winglike
projections on either side. They rolled out over the field very fast and
then I cried out as I saw them rising from the ground into the air.
Mother of God they were flying! The men in them were flying!

Rastin and Thicourt took me forward to the great buildings. They spoke
to men there and one brought forward one of the winged cars. Rastin told
me to get in and though I was terribly afraid there was too terrible a
fascination that drew me in. Thicourt and Rastin entered after me and
we sat in seats with the other man. He had before him levers and
buttons while at the car's front was a great thing like a double-oar or
paddle. A loud roaring came and that double-blade began to whirl so
swiftly that I could not see it. Then the car rolled swiftly forward
bumping on the ground and then ceased to bump. I looked down then
shuddered. The ground was already far beneath! I too was flying in the
air!

We swept upward at terrible speed that increased steadily. The thunder
of the car was terrific and as the man at the levers changed their
position we curved around and over downward and upward as though birds.
Rastin tried to explain to me how the car flew but it was all too
wonderful and I could not understand. I only knew that a wild thrilling
excitement held me and that it were worth life and death to fly thus
if but for once as I had always dreamed that men might some day do.

Higher and higher we went. The earth lay far beneath and I saw now that
Paris was indeed a mighty city its vast mass of buildings stretching
away almost to the horizons below us. A mighty city of the future that
it had been given my eyes to look on!

There were other winged cars darting to and fro in the air about us
and they said that many of these were starting or finishing journeys of
hundreds of leagues in the air. Then I cried out as I saw a great shape
coming nearer us in the air. It was many rods in length tapering to a
point at both ends a vast ship sailing in the air! There were great
cabins on its lower part and in them we glimpsed people gazing out
coming and going inside dancing even! They told me that vast ships of
the air like this sailed to and fro for thousands of leagues with
hundreds inside them.

The huge vessel of the air passed us and then our winged car began to
descend. It circled smoothly down to the field like a swooping bird
and when we landed there Rastin and Thicourt led me back to the
ground-vehicle. It was late afternoon by then the sun sinking westward
and darkness had descended by the time we rolled back into the great
city.

But in that city was not darkness! Lights were everywhere in it
flashing brilliant lights that shone from its mighty buildings and that
blinked and burned and ran like water in great symbols upon the
buildings above the streets. Their glare was like that of day! We
stopped before a great building into which Rastin and Thicourt led me.

It was vast inside and in it were many people in rows on rows of seats.
I thought it a cathedral at first but saw soon that it was not. The wall
at one end of it toward which all in it were gazing had on it pictures
of people great in size and those pictures were moving as though
themselves alive! And they were talking one to another too as though
with living voices! I trembled. What magic!

With Rastin and Thicourt in seats beside me I watched the pictures
enthralled. It was like looking through a great window into strange
worlds. I saw the sea seemingly tossing and roaring there before me
and then saw on it a ship a vast ship of size incredible without sails
or oars holding thousands of people. I seemed on that ship as I
watched seemed moving forward with it. They told me it was sailing over
the western ocean that never men had crossed. I feared!

Then another scene land appearing from the ship. A great statue
upholding a torch and we on the ship seemed passing beneath it. They
said that the ship was approaching a city the city of New York but
mists hid all before us. Then suddenly the mists before the ship cleared
and there before me seemed the city.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mother of God what a city! Climbing range on range of great
mountain-like buildings that aspired up as though to scale heaven
itself! Far beneath narrow streets pierced through them and in
the picture we seemed to land from the ship to go through those
streets of the city. It was an incredible city of madness! The
streets and ways were mere chasms between the sky-toppling buildings!
People--people--people--millions on millions of them rushed through the
endless streets. Countless ground-vehicles rushed to and fro also and
other different ones that roared above the streets and still others
below them!

Winged flying-cars and great airships were sailing to and fro over the
titanic city and in the waters around it great ships of the sea and
smaller ships were coming as man never dreamed of surely that reached
out from the mighty city on all sides. And with the coming of darkness
the city blazed with living light!

The pictures changed showed other mighty cities though none so
terrible as that one. It showed great mechanisms that appalled me. Giant
metal things that scooped in an instant from the earth as much as a man
might dig in days. Vast things that poured molten metal from them like
water. Others that lifted loads that hundreds of men and oxen could not
have stirred.

They showed men of knowledge like Rastin and Thicourt beside me. Some
were healers working miraculous cures in a way that I could not
understand. Others were gazing through giant tubes at the stars and the
pictures showed what they saw showed that all of the stars were great
suns like our sun and that our sun was greater than earth that earth
moved around it instead of the reverse! How could such things be I
wondered. Yet they said that it was so that earth was round like an
apple and that with other earths like it the planets moved round the
sun. I heard but could scarce understand.

At last Rastin and Thicourt led me out of that place of living pictures
and to their ground-vehicle. We went again through the streets to their
building where first I had found myself. As we went I saw that none
challenged my right to go nor asked who was my lord. And Rastin said
that none now had lords but that all were lord king and priest and
noble having no more power than any in the land. Each man was his own
master! It was what I had hardly dared to hope for in my own time and
this I thought was greatest of all the marvels they had shown me!

We entered again their building but Rastin and Thicourt took me first
to another room than the one in which I had found myself. They said that
their men of knowledge were gathered there to hear of their feat and to
have it proved to them.

'You would not be afraid to return to your own time Henri?' asked
Rastin and I shook my head.

'I want to return to it' I told them. 'I want to tell my people there
what I have seen--what the future is that they must strive for.'

'But if they should not believe you?' Thicourt asked.

'Still I must go--must tell them' I said.

Rastin grasped my hand. 'You are a man Henri' he said. Then throwing
aside the cloak and hat I had worn outside they went with me down to
the big white-walled room where first I had found myself.

It was lit brightly now by many of the shining glass things on ceiling
and walls and in it were many men. They all stared strangely at me and
at my clothes and talked excitedly so fast that I could not understand.
Rastin began to address them.

He seemed explaining how he had brought me from my own time to his. He
used many terms and words that I could not understand incomprehensible
references and phrases and I could understand but little. I heard again
the names of Einstein and De Sitter that I had heard before repeated
frequently by these men as they disputed with Rastin and Thicourt. They
seemed disputing about me.

One big man was saying 'Impossible! I tell you Rastin you have faked
this fellow!'

Rastin smiled. 'You don't believe that Thicourt and I brought him here
from his own time across five centuries?'

A chorus of excited negatives answered him. He had me stand up and
speak to them. They asked me many questions part of which I could not
understand. I told them of my life and of the city of my own time and
of king and priest and noble and of many simple things that they seemed
quite ignorant of. Some appeared to believe me but others did not and
again their dispute broke out.

'There is a way to settle the argument gentlemen' said Rastin
finally.

'How?' all cried.

'Thicourt and I brought Henri across five centuries by rotating the
time-dimensions at this spot' he said. 'Suppose we reverse that
rotation and send him back before your eyes--would that be proof?'

They all said that it would. Rastin turned to me. 'Stand on the metal
circle Henri' he said. I did so.

All were watching very closely. Thicourt did something quickly with the
levers and buttons of the mechanisms in the room. They began to hum and
blue light came from the glass tubes on some. All were quiet watching
me as I stood there on the circle of metal. I met Rastin's eyes and
something in me made me call goodbye to him. He waved his hand and
smiled. Thicourt pressed more buttons and the hum of the mechanisms grew
louder. Then he reached toward another lever. All in the room were
tense and I was tense.

Then I saw Thicourt's arm move as he turned one of the many levers.

A terrific clap of thunder seemed to break around me and as I closed
my eyes before its shock I felt myself whirling around and falling at
the same time as though into a maelstrom just as I had done before. The
awful falling sensation ceased in a moment and the sound subsided. I
opened my eyes. I was on the ground at the center of the familiar field
from which I had vanished hours before upon the morning of that day. It
was night now though for that day I had spent five hundred years in
the future.

There were many people gathered around the field fearful and they
screamed and some fled when I appeared in the thunderclap. I went toward
those who remained. My mind was full of things I had seen and I wanted
to tell them of these things. I wanted to tell them how they must work
ever toward that future time of wonder.

But they did not listen. Before I had spoken minutes to them they cried
out on me as a sorcerer and a blasphemer and seized me and brought me
here to the Inquisitor to you sire. And to you sire I have told the
truth in all things. I know that in doing so I have set the seal of my
own fate and that only a sorcerer would ever tell such a tale yet
despite that I am glad. Glad that I have told one at least of this time
of what I saw five centuries in the future. Glad that I saw! Glad that I
saw the things that someday sometime must come to be--

       *       *       *       *       *

It was a week later that they burned Henri Lothiere. Jean de Marselait
lifting his gaze from his endless parchment accusation and examens on
that afternoon looked out through the window at a thick curl of black
smoke going up from the distant square.

Strange that one he mused. A sorcerer of course but such a one as
I had never heard before. I wonder he half-whispered was there any
truth in that wild tale of his? The future--who can say--what men might
do--?

There was silence in the room as he brooded for a moment and then he
shook himself as one ridding himself of absurd speculations. But
tush--enough of these crazy fancies. They will have me for a sorcerer if
I yield to these wild fancies and visions _of the future_.

And bending again with his pen to the parchment before him he went
gravely on with his work.

PLEA: CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE

. . . aphorism are seldom couched in such terms that they should be
taken as they sound precisely or according to the widest extent of
signification; but do commonly need exposition and admit exception:
otherwise frequently they would not only clash with reason and
experience but interfere thwart and supplant one another.
--Issac Barrow

The very essence of an aphorism is that slight exaggeration which makes
it more biting whilst less rigidly accurate.
--Leslie Stephen




I. On Girls

A Pearl A Girl.
-Browning


There are of course girls and girls; yet at heart they are pretty much
alike.  In age naturally they differ wildly.  But this is a thorny
subject.  Suffice it to say that all men love all girls-the maid of
sweet sixteen equally with the maid of untold age.

* * *

There is something exasperatingly something-or-otherish about girls.  And
they know it--which makes them more something-or-otherish still:--there
is no other word for it.

* * *

A girl is a complicated thing.  It is made up of clothes smiles a
pompadour things of which space and prudence forbid the enumeration
here.  These things by themselves do not constitute a girl which is
obvious; nor is any one girl without these things which is not too
obvious. Where the things end and the girl begins many men have tried to
find out.

Many girls would like to be men--except on occasions.  At least so they
say but perhaps this is just a part of their something-or-otherishness.
Why they should want to be men men cannot conceive.  Men pale before
them grow hot and cold before them run before them (and after them)
swear by them (and at them) and a bit of a chit of a thing in short
skirts and lisle-thread stockings will twist able-bodied males round her
little finger.

It is an open secret that girls are fonder of men than they are of one
another--which is very lucky for the men.

Girls differ; and the same girl is different at different times.  When
she is by herself she is one thing. When she is with other girls she is
another thing.  When she is with a lot of men she is a third sort of
thing.  When she is with a man. . .  But this baffled even Agur the son
of Jakeh.

As a rule a man prefers a girl by herself.  This is natural.  And yet is
said that you cannot have too much of a good thing.  If this were true a
bevy of girls would be the height of happiness.  Yet some men would
sooner face the bulls of Bashan.

Some foolish men--probably poets--have sought for and asserted the
existence of the ideal girl.  This is sheer nonsense: there is no such
thing.  And if there were she could not compare with the real girl the
girl of flesh and blood--which (as some one ought to have said) are
excellent things in woman.

Other men equally foolish have regarded girls as playthings.  I wish
these men had tried to play with them.  They would have found that they
were playing with fire and brimstone.  Yet the veriest spit-fire can be
wondrous sweet.

Sweet?  Yes.  On the whole a girl is the sweetest thing known or
knowable.  On the 6 whole of this terrestrial sphere Nature has produced
nothing more adorable than the high-spirited high-bred girl.--Of this
she is quite aware--to our cost (I speak as a man).  The consequence is
her price has gone up and man has to pay high and pay all sorts of
things--ices sweets champagne drives church-goings and sometimes
spot-cash.

Men are always wishing they knew all about girls.  It is a precious good
thing that they don't.--Not that this is in any way disparaging to the
girls.  The fact is

A girl is an infinite puzzle and it is this puzzle that among other
things tickles the men and rouses their curiosity.

What a man doesn't know about a girl would fill a Saratoga trunk; what
her does know about her would go into her work-box.

* * *

The littlest girl is a little women.  No boy knows this--and precious
few grown up men.  Thus

Many a grown up man plays with a girl then finds himself in love with
her.  As to the girl---

Always the girl knows whether the play is leading:  she probably chooses
the game.

* * *

Very late in life does a man learn the truth (and significance) of that
ancient proverb that Kissing goes by Favour.  For

The masculine mind is the slave of Law and Justice:

Aphrodite never heard of Law or Justice: she was born at sea.  That is to
say

Few are the men who at some time in their lives have not wondered at the
vagaries of girlish complaisance: the foolish the ne'er-do-well the
bully the careless the cruel--it is to these often that a girls'
caress is given.  And

Curiously enough that is curiously enough as it seems to purblind
law-loving man--should the favored one be openly convicted that
alters not one whit his statue with the girl; for

A girl having given her heart never recalls it not wholly: she may
regret; she never recoils.  In other words

To the man of her own free lawless choice a girl is always loyal; to
subsequent and subordinate attachments she is dutiful.  So

Even the renegade if loved by a girl will be upheld by that girl
through thick and thin--secretly it may be for often the girl
nevertheless devotedly and only under compulsion will he listen to the
detractor: he may desert her or if he sticks to her he may beat her;
no matter: he holds her heart in the hollow of his hand.  But But

Few things mystify poor law-abiding man than this that the central the
profoundest the most portentous puzzle of the universe--the weal of woe
of two high-aspiring much-enduring youthful human souls should be the
sport of what seems to him the veriest and merest chance.

* * *

The unconscious search of sweet sixteen is for (in mathematical language
which will not sophisticate her) the integral of love.--Yet

In the short years between sixteen and twenty a girl's love will undergo
rapid and startling developments.

* * *

A girl with lots of brothers has more chances of matrimony than a girl
with none: she knows more of men; especially of their weaknesses and
idiosyncrasies.  And

To know the weaknesses and idiosyncrasies of men is perhaps a wife's
chief task; unless it be to put up with them.

* * *

Often enough the freckled and fringrant girl wins over the professional
beauty.

* * *

Sometimes grown-up girls are just as shy as little ones--and for the
same reasons because there is no one who knows how to play with them.

Girls often play with love as if it were one of the amusements of life;
but a day comes when love proves itself the most sensuous thing on earth.
 And

A girl is quick to discover the kind of love that is required of her.  As
a rule

Many a girl who has been sore put to it to prove herself whole-hearted.
For of course

Always every suitor expects whole heartedness. And this every girl
instinctively knows.  Indeed

Is not a half-hearted love or a half-hearted acceptress of love a
contradiction in terms?

* * *

A certain measure of the sophisticated or unsophistication of a youthful
damsel may be found in her manner o f receiving the attentions of a
stranger in a station different from her own.

Young women themselves but rarely unsophisticated view with a certain
pitying sort of curiosity unsophisticatedness in men.  And

A young man's unsophisticatedeness it is a great delight to a woman to
eradicate.  Yet

A girl regards with complex emotions the man who has blossomed under the
genial warmth of her rays; the flattery to own powers is counterbalanced
by the evidence of lack of power in him.

* * *

A girl thinks she detects flippancy in seriousness. A woman thinks she
detects seriousness in flippancy.

* * *

What would be conduct decidedly risqu in a city miss is often innocent
playfulness in a country maid.

* * *

Between the ages of sixteen and eighteen girls play with love as if it
were a doll; very soon after twenty they discover it is a dynamo.  This
is why

An early and clandestine engagement often works more havoc than
happiness. For

Either one of the parties to the concealed compact receives or pays
attention which perturb the other; or a subsequent and acknowledged
lover looks askance at the previous entanglement.  Since even if

A clandestine engagement (as is usually the case) is merely a flirtation
with the emoluments which accompany a promise to marry those emoluments
are not nice things for a subsequent and avowed lover whether masculine
or feminine to think upon.  Lastly

A laxity with regard to the claims of courtship is apt to breed a laxity
with regard to the claims of wedlock.  In short

Flirtations like clandestine engagements are an affront to love.
Accordingly

To the engagement-ring should be as attached as much importance as to the
wedding-ring.  Indeed

A difficult and a delicate path it is that a girl has to tread through
life--and often enough a dangerous. Yet with extraordinary deftness she
treads it.  She must win her a mate yet has to pretend that the mate
wins her.  She makes believe to be captured yet has herself to be intent
on the chase.  To be wooed and wedded is the law of her being yet not
for one moment dares she to exhibit too great an alacrity to obey that
law; for she knows instinctively that an easy victory prognosticates a
fickle victor.  Is she abundantly endowed with the very attributes that
make for wife-and mother-hood a strong and swaying passion and an
affection unbounded she must hold them in leash with exemplary patience;
for alas! Are they given the rein for a single passing moment instead
of being accounted unto her for righteousness they work her ruin.  She
must win her one man and she must win him for life; but she cannot pick
or choose for she must wait to be asked.

If she make test of many admirers she is described as a flirt; if
conscientious and demure she await her fate a desirable fate is by no
means assured.

In truth it seems that too often a girl must dissemble--hateful as
dissemblance in men.  T'is a hard road indeed that a girl has to travel.
To win her a fellow-farer for life she must go out of her way to
accommodate so many travelers: and this one is lured by this and that
one by that and another by something unnoticed by the throng.  But an
she dissembles one iota too much her fellow-farers look askance and he
who eventually joins her for good upbraids her for that by which she won.


Dissemblance is indeed at once the boon and the bane of a girl: without
it she thinks to be overlooked (often enough a preposterous assumption);
with it she is looked upon too much.  And always

Always a girl has to pretend that never did she descend to dissemblance.
--Which nevertheless is sometimes absolutely true for

Just now and then there happens that miracle of miracles where their
flames up in the man and their flames up in the maid in both at once
unaided and unlooked-for that divine and supra-mundane spark which
smolders lambent in every youthful breast: when maid and man take mutual
fire at touch of hands and look of eyes--fire lit at that vestal altar
which knows no source and burns for aye.




II. On Men

Duskolon esti to thremma anthropus.
--Plato


For man the over-grown boy life has commonly two and only two sides:
work and play.  Happy he who has for a helpmate one who possesses the
faculty of increasing a zeal for the first and of adding a zest to the
second.  Wherein O woman thou mayest happily find the two-fold secret
of thy life-work.  For

Man is a greedy animal: he wants all or nothing.  And fortunately for
him

Women tacitly extol man's greed: they will not be shared any more than
they will share.

There is something canine in the masculine nature: like a dog over a
bone it snarls at the very approach of a rival.

* * *

It is curious but it is true that proud man becomes prouder (and--more
curious still--at the same time humbler) when weak woman gives him
something--a look a smile a locket her hair a kiss herself.

* * *

The greater a man's faith in himself the greater his mistress hers in
him.  And perhaps the greater his mistress her faith in a man the
greater his in himself.  For

A woman's faith in a man works wonders.

* * *

A man to whom a woman cannot look up she cannot love.  Yet

It is marvelous how a woman contrives to find something to look up to in
a man.

* * *

Many men forget the artistic tendency of the feminine temperament a
tendency which shows itself in many ways--their love of pretty things
of pretty ways and of pretty words.  From which three alone we may
deduce the rule that

When with the woman he admires and whose admiration he seeks a man
cannot be too careful of his dress his speech and his manners.

* * *

A believer in Woman is a believer in Good.  And vice versa and mutatis
mutandis.

* * *

Man's standard of value of a woman is usually determined by the scale of
his own emotions.  That is to say

The pedestal upon which a man places a woman (a man always puts a woman
upon a pedestal) is a pedestal erected solely by the effect upon himself
of her charms.

* * *

A man may boast himself invincible by men; never by woman.

* * *
The lady-killer is always an object of attraction to ladies even to
those whom he makes no attempt to slay.

* * *

It may perhaps be a thing as unreasonable as certainly it is
indisputable that however much wild oats a man may himself sow he
invariably entertains a very peculiar objection to any woman near or dear
to him entering upon this particular branch of agriculture.

* * *

He is a fool who does not bear himself before his lady-love as a prince
among men.

* * *

Some men are so gallant that they will never be outdone by the woman who
encourages them.  But it often leads to strange embarrassments and
entanglements.

* * *

Few things terrify a man more than the knowledge of a woman's ability to
make her emotions--when if ever he arrives at it.

* * *

That is a very silly man who thing she can play one woman off against
another.  For

In matters of emotional finesse the masculine instance is nowhere: it is
blinded befogged befooled at every turn.

Heaven help the man who is dragged into a quarrel between two wrathful
ladies!

* * *

Three things there be--nay four--which man can never be sure how a
greatsoever his acumen his astuteness or his zeal: a woman; a race
horse; a patent; and the money-market.  They defy both faith and fate;
they should be the recreations not the resources of life; and he is a
fool who stakes more than a portion of his substance on any one of them.

* * *

What a paltry thing after all is man man uncomplemented by woman! Left
to himself he stagnates; linked with a woman he rises---or sinks.  A
gentle touch stimulates him a confiding heart makes of him a new
creature.  Under the rays of feminine sympathy he expands who else would
remain inert.  Fame may allure him friends encourage him fortune cause
him a momentary smile but only woman makes him; and fame friends
fortune all are naught if there be not at his side a sharer of his weal.
A man will strive for fortune strip himself for friends scour the earth
for fame; but were there no woman in the world to be won not one of
these things would he do.

* * *




III. On Women

Ehret die Fanen!
-Schiller


From woman who e're she be there seems to emanate a potency ineffable
to man--impalpable invisible divine.  It lies not in beauty or
grace not even in manner or mein; and it requires neither wiles nor
artifice.  It is not the growth of long and intimate acquaintance for
often it acts spontaneously and at once; and neither the woman who
possesses it nor the man who succumbs to it can give it a name.  For to
say that it consists in the effluence or influence of personality or
temperament of affinity or passion of sympathy or charm is to say
nothing save that we know not what it is.   All unknown to herself it
wraps its owner round with airs the which to breathe uplifts the spirit
and yet may be perturbs the heart of man.  Even its effects are
recondite and obscure.  It allures; but how it allures now man shall
tell.  It impels; but to what does not appear.  It rouses all manner of
hopes stirs sleeping ambition and desires and aspirations unappeasable;
but for what purport or to what end none stays to inquire .  It incites;
sometimes it enthralls. It innervates; it exhaults.  Under its spell
reason is flung to the winds and matters of great mundane moment are
trivial and of no account: for it bewilders the wit and snatches the
judgment of sane and rational men.  It is most powerful in youth; it is
most powerful upon youth; yet some retain it till far on in years and no
age but feels its sway:--a veiled and mysterious force; sometimes
daemonical often divine: at once the delight and the despair of man.
After all

The man who declares he understands women declares his folly.  For

If woman were not such a mystery she would not be such an attraction.
For again

What is known is ignored.  (But woman need have no cause for
apprehension.) Besides

Men may be classified; women never.  This is why

Generalizing in the case of women is useless; since

Woman is a species of which every woman is a variety.  And every man must
make up his mind to this that

Every woman is a study in herself.  However

If women were comprehensible to men men and women would be friends not
lovers (But the race is safe). The simple fact is that

Womanliness is the supreme attraction in however fair or however frail a
personality it is embodied.   And

The sacred function of all womanhood is to kindle in man the divine spark
by means 30 of the mystic flame that burns ever in the vestal breast.

* * *

Every true woman's orbit is determined by two forces: Love and Duty.
Which is another way of saying that

Women like the lark are true to the kindred points of heaven and home.
But

It is only when the two foci are coincident and identical that her orbit
becomes the perfect circle and her home becomes her heaven.

* * *

A woman's heart is an unfathomable ocean: nothing ever filled it; no one
ever plumbed it.  At the surface are glancing waves or flying spume or
it may be raging billows; beneath are silent depths invisible to man.  A
thousand streams flow into it in vain.  Towards varying coast-lines it
bears itself variously; here placid and content; there dashing furious.
But none ever stamped his marked upon its brim and always it remains the
refluent reluctant sea.  Of it man knows only the waves that break or
ripple at his feet. It betrays no 31 secrets; it asks not to be
understood.  Storm and calm but stir or still its surface and what
things it hides forever engulfed no one may learn.   Subtle yet mighty;
an eternal and entrancing mystery to man.

A man's heart is the enclosing shore; measurable impressionable
definite and overt; thinking to house that sea shaping it over looking
it and staying and governing its tides.  Yet changed by it crumbling
before it yielding to it: at once its guardian and its slave.  Yet
perhaps

The placidest of seas is that which is wholly land-locked.

*  * *

Women apparently were made for men; men for themselves.  Certainly

Men seem to carry out this design of Nature that they should be
ministered to by women.

* * *

A woman asks a woman questions in order to discover something.  She asks
a man questions in order to discover the man.

* * *

he last thing that a woman will risk is her personal appearance.  Which
is saying a good deal for

A woman will risk an interview at an unseasonable hour but not in an
unseasonable frock.

* * *

Never never take a woman au pied de la letter.

* * *

Women's rights are: to be loved.

* * *

Women's duties are: to love.

* * *

There is always something sovereign and monarchial about a woman: like a
queen's her wishes are her commands.  And

In matrimony woman's sovereignty is not abdicated.  By no means; it is
only transformed from an absolute into a constitutional monarch : she
acts then by and with the advice of her First Lord.  This is the ideal
State.

* * *

Woman's true function as a citizen in this world is: to spur men on to
high and noble action.  And this quite unconsciously she does.

Woman's true function as a woman in the world is: to evoke man's most
fervid emotions and at the same time to keep them at their highest
level.  And this she also does--perhaps not quite so unconsciously.

* * *

They err who call women illogical.  Feminine logic is inexorable. But it
proceeds per saltum.  It is man who has laboriously to reason step by
step.

* * *

The most wayward woman craves control: To let a woman have her own way is
interpreted by her as indifference.  And

The surest way to fail to please a woman is to let her do what she
pleases.

* * *

Woman is born to acting as the sparks fly upward.  And

What a woman really is nobody knows least of all herself.
To see a woman as she really is one must see her with her babe.  For

It is curious but it is true that not even before the passionate and
accepted lover to whom she has utterly devoted herself can a woman bare
her heart as can she to her babe.  Perhaps we may go so far as to say
that

Motherhood always partially eclipses wife-hood:

When the child comes the man stands aside.  For

It is not within the capability of man to evoke or to develop the
totality of woman.  There are feminine potentialities he is powerless to
awake.  There is a portion of womanliness always hidden from him.  To her
babe alone she opens the innermost recesses of her soul.  For him she
wears no masks affect no accent plays no part.  Even her features take
on a different and unique expression before the offspring of her womb.
Never is she more womanly never so strong never so quite never so
self-contained never so completely herself and never so beautify when
bending over her helpless infant son.   And naturally: for say what one
will

Motherhood is the goal of womanhood.  And

Howsoever she comes by it a woman's burthen is always to her That Holy
Thing.  So

No one knows what a woman is like till she is a mother. In other words

Motherhood reveals womanhood. And be it remembered

There be childless women--both spinsters and wives--who could mother
mankind in their bosoms.  Such women wield great influence.  For

Many a mere man there is has owed his all to a motherly woman.

* * *

Nor speech not restore nor expression of feature nor all combined
will ever reveal the real feelings of a woman.  To unbosom herself is
impossible to woman.  Do not expect it for

Definite and accurate utterance is not given to woman.

* * *

The chief business of woman is: first to get married; second to get
others married.

* * *

It is difficult to say which have played the greater havoc among men: the
women with too much conscience or the woman with none.

* * *

When a woman repulses beware.  When a woman beckons be warier.

* * *

Woman are always prepared for emergencies.

* * *

With woman tact and jealousy rarely go hand in hand; tact and spite
never.

The only instance in which a woman's tact is apt to be at fault is in
detraction of a woman whom she regards as her rival;

The instance in which a woman's tact is seen as its best is in deploying
the men who she knows are rivals for her hand.  And usually

When a woman has more than one admirer she not only deploys them but
tries to make them advance en echelon.  For

Few things disconcert a woman more than a multiple and simultaneous
attack delivered front a front.  But

The way in which a woman will maneuver her attackers is marvelous.

* * *

They say a woman cannot argue.  Hear her explain an indiscretion!

* * *

An independent woman is a contradiction in terms.  For
Woman's chief want is to feel that she is wanted.  Therefore it is that

With women cruelty is more easily borne than coldness.  Indeed
It is astonishing how much downright cruelty a woman will stand from the
man she loves or has loved.  On the other hand

Melancholy also attracts women.  Naturally

Women are made to soothe to pity to comfort to delight.  Therefore it
is that

To see a strong man in a weak woman's arms is a sight which should arouse
--not our laughter but our(1) envy.  So it does.

(1) Common Gender

* * *

Let not the simpleton think a woman will sympathize with his simplicity:

No woman is a simpleton.

What women admire is a subtle combination of forcefulness and gentleness.


If a woman has to choose between forcefulness and gentleness always she
will sacrifice the latter.  And

It is astonishing to what lengths forcefulness can go without endangering
a woman's admiration.  If it sweeps her off her feet. . .  well

In nothing does a woman so clearly exhibit the inherent femininity of her
nature as in the delight with which at the bottom of her heart she
recalls moments when she has been swept off her feet.   She may sigh over
them; but

Generally a woman's sighs are by no means those of remorse.
A woman never brings pure reason to bear upon her actions; she acts by
sentiment 40 and she judges her acts by sentiment.  This is why

Even when a woman has deceived and betrayed she does not regard herself
culpable.  Always she says to herself she was driven to it and
therefore she is blameless.  Accordingly

A penitent woman is rare:

Even when a man with his so-called superior reason thinks he has proved
her wrong at the bottom of her heart she knows herself right.

* * *

Many have been the discussions as to woman's most powerful weapon.  The
simple fact is she is armed cap a pie(2). Indeed
Every woman is a sort of feminine Proteus not only in the myriad shapes
she assumes but also in her amenability to nothing but superior force.
Women form perhaps where men are concerned the single exception to the
rule that in union there is strength.  One woman often enough is
irrepressible; two (be the second her own mother) break the charm an
association of women is the feeblest of forces.

(2) Cf. Cowper:

They are all women and they dart
Like Porcupines from every part.
-Anacreontics

* * *

All women are rivals.  And this they never forget.  Consequently

Mistrust a truce between hostile ladies.

* * *

Amongst women modesty is of infinitely more potent influence than is
ability.  Yet

To a woman's modesty ability is a wonderfully enhancing setting.  And

Modesty is the most complex and the most varied of emotions.  Perhaps

When modesty and frailty go hand in hand there is no more delectable
combination known to men; and Aphrodite has not the subtle charm of a
Cynthia.  Perhaps this is why such

A wondrous halo of romance hangs about the name of a Heloise of a
Marguerite of a Marianna Alcoforado; of a Concetta of Afragola; of a
Catalina; of Robert le Diable's Helena of Isolde; of Lucia of Bologna
the enchantress of Ottaviano; of Francesca; of Guenevere; of the sweet
seventeen-year old novice of Andouillets Margarita the fille who was
rosy as the morn; of the Beguine who nursed Captain Shandy; of the
fille de chamber who walked along the Quai de Conti with Yorick; of
Ameilia Viviani the inspirer of Shelly's most ecstatic lyric; of
Dryden's masque-loving Lucretia.  For after all

Is the star any the less starry to the rapt star-gazer when he finds it
to be a tremulous planet?

Cynthia may have blushed in heaven; bit did the blush make her any less
lovely to the Latmian?

Only in the clear and unclouded pool is the star undimmed embosomed.

* * *

They say a woman is capricious.  But the consistency of woman's
capriciousness is only exceeded by the capriciousness of man's
consistency.

Man calls woman capricious simply because he is too stupid to comprehend
the laws by which she is swayed. Woman does not call man capricious.
--The inference is obvious.

* * *

To women the profoundest mysteries of the universe give place to two
things: a lover and a baby.--But perhaps these are the profoundest
mysteries of the universe.

* * *

How many women there be who deeming themselves fitted to be the consorts
of kings yet comport themselves dutifully as the wives of wastrels! And
indeed

Given beauty cleverness and grace 44 there is no position to which a
woman could not aspire; for

Being Woman she is ex officio Queen.

* * *

Speak to a woman disparagingly of her sex--she is up in arms.

Speak to her disparagingly of a member of her sex--well she will not
be up in arms.  The reason for her bellicosity in the former case is the
fact that

A woman always interprets abstract disparagement of her sex personally.
And she is perfectly right.

* * *

It is not only the woman who cannot be accounted quite as stainless as
the stars that sometimes trade on their charms.

* * *

When a strong-souled woman wholly and unreservedly loves her love will
go to lengths passing the comprehension of man.  For

Women prefer an despot to a dependent.

* * *

It is marvelous to what a pitch of demureness features by nature that the
most coquettish can be set.

(A Man's features are often a clue to his character; a woman's rarely.)
So it comes about that

The owner of a seraphic face is often owner of a temper satanic.
Nevertheless

Often enough a spice of diablerie in a woman at once enhances all her
charms.

It is indeed fortunate for the men that so many women are unaware of the
power of their charms.

* * *

A woman would much rather you lied to her concerning herself than that
you told her something unpleasant to hear.

* * *

Some women seem to be envious of some men's familiarity with immorality.

* * *

It is by woman that a woman will be first suspected; and it is by a woman
she will be last forgiven.  The last thing a woman will ask you for is:
your esteem.  And yet

Cast a slur upon a woman's character and you are considered indiscreet.
Cast a slur upon a woman's personal appearance and you are considered
culpable.

* * *

Fashion is a woman's sole law.  And

The surest evidence of strong-mindedness in woman is to fly in the fact
of fashion.

* * *

Ridicule is woman's keenest weapon; it is the poisoned arrow in her
quiver.  Well is it for the men that she never or so rarely has
recourse to it.

* * *

A woman is quick to discern the quality of the admiration bestowed upon
her.

* * *

No one not even herself knows what a woman will do next.--Doubtless
this is trite.  But it is true as trite.  Yet men rarely find it out till
late in life--and forget it as soon as found out.

* * *

A woman can say more in a sigh than a man can say in a sermon.

* * *

Nothing piques a woman so much as indifference to her favors.
Indifference to her undiscovered passion she quite otherwise regards.

* * *

The woman knows the male heart probably better than does it itself.   She
knows above all things that to hold that heart she must never wholly
satisfy it.  And many--and multiform--and marvelous--are the ruses by
which she accomplishes that end.  And yet

Women there are who firmly believe that were they to try they could
enthrall any man beyond possibility of extrication.  And 48 so perhaps
they could; but the achievement would require as much unscrupulousness as
it would seductiveness.

The seductive and unscrupulous woman is hatred of women.

* * *

Under the gaze of a group of men whom she knows that her brilliancy
dazzles a woman like the snow-clad hearth sparkles:
Under the gaze of a man by whom she knows she is passionately desired
like the same earth under the lordly sun she melts.

* * *

All women think they can cozen men: few women think they can cozen women.

* * *

The women who perturb men most are those who combine too effectively
adorableness with desirableness.

* * *

As in nature so in humanity flight on the part of the lady is not
always symbol of unwillingness of pursuit.  On the other hand

Feminine audacity by no means betokens feminine immodesty.

Feminine obduracy is invincible by man.  Luckily it is rare.

* * *

Men call women variable: did she not vary men would tire.  This women
instinctively know.

Women rightly dislike and disgust variability in men.  For

Women like best to be liked: to lead gives them but paltry and temporary
pleasure.  (Though this they do not always instinctively know; or if
they do they conceal their knowledge.)  And

Variability is incompatible with leadership.

* * *

How delicately a loving woman reproves! How defiantly an unloving!

* * *

How many lonely women--married and unmarried--the world contains only
these lonely women know.

* * *

The feminine mtier par excellence is: to allure.  And

The subtle and elaborate means by which women will devise to intensify
the lure passes the comprehension o f men. Yet

In all ages to make herself attractive was as right and proper for the
woman as to make himself feared was for the man.  Besides

With women the art of attracting has long since become second nature.

* * *

Women are quick to recognize a rake.  For

A rake always rouses curiosity never aversion.

* * *

A worsted woman always either silently or volubly calls down a curse
upon her successful rival.--And 't is a curse that too often fails.

Many women handicap other women; and they handicap them in multifarious
ways.  Probably the one most frequently used is lavishness of favors.

The woman who is lavish of favors is hated of her stricter sisters. But
before these what an air of bravado she wears!

* * *

As a rule women are far better readers of character than are men.  A
woman will often startle a man by her penetrating insight into character.
And

Many a man has been put on his guard by female institution.

* * *

The fragilest woman will be ill content with suppressed embraces. And

The ablest-bodied woman loves being petted.  Even

A prude is a shy coquette.

* * *

The man who judges of a woman by her letters is a fool.--Her gesture
will contain more matter than her journal.  Besides

The woman who could punctuate could reason.

* * *

The debut of a younger sister evokes mixed emotions.

* * *

The prayer--uttered or unexpressed--of many an undowered young woman
is May a moneyed man fall in love with me ! And she is not always
over-careful to add And may I fall in love with that moneyed man!

* * *

If the New Woman (3) turns out to be a fitter companion for men than
the old no man will complain of her novelty.  Yet

Men regard the advent of the New Woman rather askance.  Why? Because

To judge from certain feminine utterances the New Woman seems more
inclined to aim at rivalry than at companionship with man.
--However there need be no fears as to the result since

Such is the mysterious potency of womanhood that whether new or old
woman will always lead man captive.  Besides

As every new variety of fashion in dress seems becoming to women so it
is probable every variety of fashion in manners will become them also.
But probably

The phrase the New Woman is not unlike the phrase the New Chemistry:
the materials are the same; what is new is the nomenclature.

(3) A phrase (and not much more than a phrase) much in vogue in Europe
and America in the last two decades of the nineteenth century of the area
known as Christian.

* * *

A woman's peccadilloes are generally worse than a man's. At all events
they are more reprobated.

* *  *

Abashment intensifies a woman's love for him so making her abashed.  And

There is a shame that is sweeter than joy.  (As

There is a fear more tremulous than delight.) For

Mastery is a woman's standard of man.  And
There is an element of the freest and frankest savagery in the most
refined and spiritual of women.  (How otherwise

Can any one explain the extraordinary fable of Selene and Pan?(4)
--And man?

--But that man was ever a savage.  It may be added that

The defenselessness of woman is a conventional fiction: she can avert an
attack by a look; she can terminate a siege by a taunt.

(4) Though Browning tried.  See Dramatic Idyls Pan and Luna

* * *

Solomon has objurgated the invincibly garrulous woman.  The invincibly
taciturn woman is so rare as to have escaped objurgation.  Yet she too is
a terror to men.

* * *

Every woman is suspicious and jealous of any woman that opens a man's
eyes; even though she knows that

Never was there a woman who could and would deliberately wholly enlighten
a man.

And yet marvelous and curious amongst things curious and marvelous
will but a woman fling artifice to the winds and look and act and say as
great Nature prompts--wildly willfully wantonly--that woman will
captivate as no feminine wiles will ever captivate.

* * *

If the man were worth it many a woman would dispense with the marriage
ceremony.  For

Ah! Love--love--love--given love what else is needed? (Unfortunately

Love can never be sure of itself--much less of anything else.
Accordingly

The marriage contract is a device on the part of the community to provide
for the preservation of the home: it makes the parties promise fidelity.)
But

Precious few are the men who are worth the risking.  Unfortunately

More women succumb to strength of will than to strength of character.

Neither in general are women overcurious to enquire whether the
strength of character.

Neither in general are women over curious to enquire whether the
strength of the masculine will makes for good or for evil.

So long as the masculine will overmaster the feminine the feminine mind
is satisfied.  Of course there are exceptions but as a rule

Women--whether young or old married or single strong-minded or weak--
are never happier than when they can depend on a man.  Accordingly

The lover or the husband who is weaker than and depends upon the woman
will some day rue his weakness and dependence.  And yet

To see a strong male at her feet--that is exquisite to the woman.  So
exquisite that

It is with difficulty that a woman refrains from exhibiting a man's
servitude to others.   On the other hand

There is an element of intimidation in a resplendent woman.  And of this
she is aware.--Hence perhaps her power.

* * *

A woman will attain her ends by adroit finesse where a man would blunder
into open hostility.  And

It is well that man should blind his eyes to feminine wiles since

Always a woman kindly pretends oblivion of masculine blunders.

* * *

The woman whose tastes and refinements are above her station is
in pitiable plight: she is too fastidious to espouse the men who would
marry her; the men she would marry she rarely meets.  For
The only thing that to love is insupportable is vulgarity.  Since

Love romantic love the efflorescence and bloom of life is besmirched
unless tenderly touched.

* * *

To generalize passes the wit of woman; but in penetration she is
preternatural.

* * *

What fascinates a woman is the man who unwittingly attracts her against
her will.  But such a man rouses a combination of emotions comprehensible
only by women.

* * *

A woman's answer to an insuperable argument is: a look.  And a  most
cogent answer it is.  Indeed

Speech is a woman's least effective weapon; rarely if ever does she
resort to it:

In the affairs of life as in the affairs of love where men be
concerned it is upon her personality that she relies not upon her
speech whether written or uttered.

Her personal appearance is to a woman what his personal honor is to a
man: it must be immaculate; constant with the fashion of the hour; and
strictly in accordance with her or his status in society.  Accordingly

Dress and demeanor--these form the code of feminine ethics.  Even

Deception on the part of a woman is merely diplomacy;

Women deceive only be cause man is too blind to see.  That is to
say

Since man in past ages has never allowed woman either freedom of action
or frankness of speech it is not to be expected of her that she should
be all at once an adept in their use.--To her credit be it said that

Generally a woman deceives only n order to arouse or to retain the
admiration of man.  For example

Many a woman has surreptitiously made love to the man--and few are the
men who have detected it.

* * *

Why this woman fascinates all who come within the sphere of their
influence and that women does not no earthly sage will ever know.  As
well ask what makes one man a Napoleon another a poltroon.  So too

It is impossible for a woman to say 'I will be loved' as it is for a man
to say 'I will be obeyed.'--Perhaps

Love and Power are divine miracles.

* * *

(At the risk of treading on delicate ground ground off which I shall be
hooted by the modern woman I venture to say that)

The idea that a woman is the property of the man of her choice rail as
it as the woman may has not yet been ousted from the feminine mind--and
heart.  Indeed

So firmly implanted in the feminine breast is the idea of the ownership
of her by the man that it is to the man who assumes and exercises
ownership that she clings.  This is why

A woman easily changes her allegiance; since

Allegiance to a woman means loyalty to the man who assumes and
exercises ownership over her:

Let a man who a fractional part of a second evince the shadow of a doubt
of his proprietorship--at once he undermines a woman's allegiance.
Consequently

It is folly for men to express amazement at the ease with which  a woman
will transfer herself and her affections.

A woman will transfer herself bodily over and over again but only
because the previous owner lightly esteemed or weakly maintained his
ownership.  As a matter of fact

In pristine days woman was naturally and necessarily the property the
chattel of the man: marriage was not then a matrimonial syndicate of
two: marriage meant that a woman sought a provider a supporter a
defender; the man a mate for his delight his comfort and his solace a
keeper op is cave or hut a mother and nurse for his heirs.  And
provision support and defense being in pristine days matters of
strength prowess or cunning naturally and necessarily pristine man 65
gained him and kept him a mate by strength prowess or cunning; he
regarded that mate as his by right of force not as a partner in a
compact.  And

The most complicated of modern communities has no whit altered the
relationship of man to mate conceal though it may the origin and history
of marriage.  Finally

No woman at the bottom of her heart has any objection to being owned.
Indeed (though no woman would say it a man may)

Every woman at the bottom of her heart delights to be owned and tacitly
and secretly seeks the man who she thinks will glory in that ownership
and keep his property safe--not only from material harms but from
temptations to changes of ownership. In which last little fact lies a
curious truth.

Women like to be defended against themselves.  In this little matter men
and women differ: That any other man should dare for  one instant to
covet or alienate (5) that most precious of his possessions his mate
--nothing rouses to a higher pitch man's unappeasable wrath than this;

Against the man so daring a woman's wrath is never roused: rather she
regards him as one having discernment and his daring is a commendable
compliment to herself.  In fine and in short

Allegiance to a man on the part of a woman means in her eyes loyalty
to him who properly exercises the right of ownership.  In simple truth

A woman gives herself to a man: to the man who proves himself worthy the
gift she is true.

And this is why women all women even the New ones love being petted
and admired and made much of all their lives: this but proves the
possession of the gift to be appreciated.  Besides

The male is the dominant animal--not necessarily in his cave or his hut
--by no means but in the stress and struggle of life; and women tacitly
(though never openly) look up to and admire this dominance even when
exercised over themselves; since THIS in turn proves the masterfulness
the worth of the man; albeit sometimes they rebel against it if carried
to far.  At least

Unless a man continues to exhibit his appreciation of the gift by word as
well as by deed the woman is apt to imagine that that appreciation is on
the wane.

(5) How women must laugh in their sleeves at the fact that one man may
sue another in a court of law for alienating his wife's affections!

IV. On Love

Amore che muove il sole e l'altre stelle.
--Dante


The beginning middle and end of love--is a sigh.

* * *

All things point to the infinite; and love more than all things else.

* * *

Complex as is the character of love here are two things which love
always does: always it

Refines the thoughts
 And heart enlarges;
           --Milton

and

Love dyes all things a cerulean hue.  (What a pity it is not a fast
color!)

* * *

Love is the most antimonial of emotions: it worships yet it will not
stop at sacrilege; it will build about its object a temple of adoration
then desecrate the fane; it will give all yet ruthlessly  seize
everything; it delights in pleasing yet it sometimes wittingly wounds;
its ineffable tenderness often merges into an inclemency extraordinary;
--symbol of universal duality it is at once demonical and angelic.

* * *

Nothing stands still in this world not even love: it must grow or it
withers.  And perhaps

That is the strongest love which surmounts the greatest number of
obstacles.

* * *

Love to some is an intoxicant; to others an ailment.  To all it is a
necessity.

* * *

As is one's character so is one's love. And

Perhaps the deepest love is the quietest.

* * *

Love is as implacable as it is un-appeasable.  Nay more

Love is merciless: as merciless to its votary as to its victim: For

Love would slay rather than surrender; would for-swear rather than forgo.

* * *

Some loves like some fevers render the patient immune--at all events
to that particular kind of contagion.

Many lovers are vaccinated in early youth.

* * *

Only love can comprehend and reciprocate love.  This is why

If of two sensitive human souls the one loves passionately and the
other not at all the other is unwittingly blind and deaf to love's
clamors and claims: the one may ardently urge; the other but passively
yields:--

Only the famished understand the pangs of the hungered.

Of a great and reciprocated love there is one and only one sign: the
expression of the eyes.  Who that has seen it was ever deceived by its
counterfeit?

Did ever the same love-light shine in the same eyes twice?

The light of love in the eyes may take on a thousand forms: exultant
jubilation a trustful happiness; infinite appeasement or promises
untold; an adoration supreme or a complex oblation; tenderness
ineffable or heroic resolves; implicit faith; unquestioning confidence;
abounding pity; unabashed desire. . .

He who shall count the stars of heaven shall enumerate the radiances of
love.

* * *

There is no Art of Loving (1); though as Ovid says love must be guided
by art (2).  Yet

If love did not come by chance it would never come at all.

(1) Ovid wrote not Art of Loving (Ars Amandi); he wrote on the
Amatorial Art (Ars Amatoria).

(2) Arte regendus amor.--Ars Amatoria I 4.

* * *

To each of us himself is the centre of the visible universe.  But when
love comes it alters this Ptolemaic theory.  Yet

It is a significant fact that love which more than any other thing in
this world is the great bringer-together of hearts begins its
mysterious work as a separator and puter-at-a-distance.  For

When love first dawns in the breast of youth it throws about its object
a sacred aureole which awes at the same time that it inspires the
faithful worshipper.

* * *

Can only two walk abreast in the path of love? How many try to widen that
strait and narrow way!

* * *

Love raises everything to a higher plane; but nothing higher than the man
or woman who is loved.

Is there anything about which love does not shed a halo? Indeed

Love is a sort of transfiguration.  And when on the mount we can very
truly say It is good for us to be here.

If there is any sublunary thing equal in value to the true love of a
faithful woman it has not yet entered into the heart of man to conceive.


True love makes all things loveable--except perhaps the chaperon.

Was there ever man or woman yet who was not bettered by a true love?

True love is ever diffident and fearful of its own venturesomeness (3).
But this not every woman understands.

Too often the Phantasm of love and not the Verity wins the day (4).
Women who seek a real lover should beware the overbold one.

(3) Cf. La volupte Nous rend hardis l'amour nous rend timides.
--Voltaire La Pucelle Chant vi.

(4) See Leopardi Storia del Genere Humano where the Verities of Truth
and Love and Justice never leave the throne of Jove but their Phantasms
are sent down amongst men.

* * *

To merge the THEE and the ME into one--that is ever the attempt of love.
It is impossible.  Yet perhaps

They are happiest who can longest disbelieve in the impossibility of this
amatorial fusion; for it may be that such

Incredulity is favorable to romance.

* * *

Love is not exactly a sacrifice; it is an exchange.  The lover indeed
gives his heart; he expects another in return.

* * *

Love is like life: no apparatus can manufacture it; kill it and nothing
in the heavens above or in the earth beneath or in the waters under the
earth will resuscitate it.

How many a forlorn human wight has tried to resuscitate love!

* * *

To such heights does love exalt the lover that he or she will live for
days in the remembered delights of a look a word a gesture.  But

One thing is impossible to love: love cannot create love; the intensest
and most fervent love is powerless to evoke a scintillation of love.

Love may worship it may adore it may transfigure it may exalt the
object of its devotion to the skies; but it cannot cause that object to
emit one ray of love in return.

* * *

Hate may be concealed; love never.

* * *

The greater the imaginative altitude of love the lower the boiling
point.  But

Love cannot always be kept at high pressure.

* * *

The young think love is the winning-post of life the old know it is a
turn in the course.  Nevertheless it is a fateful turn.

* * *

In love the imagination plays a very large part.  And this may be
variously interpreted.  Thus

By man love is regarded as a sort of sacred religion; by woman as her
every-day morality.  The former is the more exhilarating; but the latter
is more serviceable.  Indeed

Love and religion are very near akin: both inspire and both elevate.
And

If faith hope and charity are the basis of religion there never was
such as religion as love.  And

Love is the only religion in which there have been no heretics.  Why?
Because woman are at once its object and its priesthood.

Love art and religion are but different phases of the same emotion:
awe reverence worship and sacrifice in the presence of the supreme
ideal.

Love knows no creed.  Nay more

Love acknowledges no deity but itself and accepts no sanctions but its
own: it is autonomous.  And yet--

And yet love sometimes feels constrained to offer a liturgical
acquiescence to the rubric of Reason.  In short

Between the prelatical domination of Reason and the recusant
Protestantism of Love there has ever been strife.  Or in plain language
There are two codes of ethics: one that of the romantic heart; the other
that of the practical head.  Who shall assimilate them?

The heart in its profoundest depths feels that something is due to
Reason; and Reason in its highest flights feels that something is due
to the heart.

Is there a divine duplicity in the human soul? And yet after all

All love seeks is: love.  Yet love little knows that

In seeking love love enters on an endless search.   Since

Love is an endless effort to realize the Ideal.  For

Love always beckons over insurmountable barriers to uninhabitable realms;
promises insupportable possibilities; lures to an unimaginable goal.  Yet

Love has a myriad counterfeits.  And

Men and women interpret the word differently.  Even

Different women interpret the word love differently.  Thus

To one woman love is as the rising of the sun: it shines but once in her
whole life-day; it floods everything with its light; it brightens the
world; it dazzles her.

To another woman love is as the rising of a star: a fresh one may appear
every hour of her life and nor she nor her world is one whit affected by
its rays.  Indeed one would hardly err if he said that

Many a woman really does not know whether she is in love or not.  She
is sought--that she perceives; but which of her seekers is worthiest
which most zealous which merely takes her fancy and which appeals to
her heart--on these matters she meditates long--to the exasperation of
course of the individual seeker.  Accordingly

Men carried away by their own passionate impulse detest calculation of
the part of women:

Since HE  stakes his all on impulse in the matter of love says man why
should woman stay to consider? Foolish man! he forgets that

A woman always weighs a man's declaration of love--and legitimately--
and naturally; perhaps legitimately because naturally; for once again

What a woman stays to consider in the matter of love is not the potency
of the impulse of the moment but the permanent efficacy of the emotion.
Therefore it is that

Woman unwittingly obeys great Nature's laws.

* * *

Many imagine that love is a thing like a chemical element: with a fixed
symbol 84 and a rigid atomic equivalent.  And so it may be; but like the
philosopher's stone hitherto it has defied detection in its elemental
form.  The fact is probably that

Love may be compared to a substance that is never found free and which
not only combines in all sorts of relationships with all sorts of
substances but also like many another chemical body takes on the most
varied forms not only in these relationships but also under varying
pressures and temperatures.--Or perhaps it would be better to say that

Love may be compared to a musical note: to the unthinking it is a simple
sound; to the more experienced it is know to consist of endless and
complicated harmonical vibrations; harmonizing with some and making
discord with other notes by regular but unknown laws; differing
according to the timbre of the emitter; reverberating under certain
conditions; lost to the ear in others; and only responding to resonators
vibrating synchronously with itself.  Lastly

There is a whole gamut of love.--Changing that simile we may say that

Love is not like the sun: a unit and practically the same wherever seen;
it is like light: all-pervading universally diffused and reflected and
refracted and absorbed in varying degrees and varying manners by various
objects.  And

Than a great and pure love can anyone point to anything on earth
greater and more purifying?

The lesser luminary perturbs the tide of human passion; the greater light
draws it upward--none the less veritably because in tinted formless
vapor.  This is symbolical of love.

It is the nascent thing that evokes the keenest emotions: the bud--the
babe--dawn--and the first beginnings of love.  So
Love like sun-light wears its most tender tints at dawn.

* * *

It still remains a mystery that out of a townful of folk two particular
hearts should worry themselves into early graves because this one cannot
get that other.  Yet

It is almost enough to destroy one's faith in the uniqueness of love to
see from how narrow a circle of acquaintances men and women choose their
spouses. Were Plato's two half-souls separated by the diameter of the
globe--that were lamentable.

* * *

The man often argues that esteem will grow into passion.  The woman knows
that the argument is utterly fallacious.  Yet
Unless passion is guarded by esteem--as the calyx ensheaths the
corolla the former is prone to wither.

In youthful love as in the enfolded bud esteem and passion--like calyx
and corolla---seem one and identical;

It is only the full-blown flower that displays its constituent parts.

Would that love could remain ever in bud!

* * *

To some love comes like a flash; to others as the burning of tinder.

In all when real love is kindled it devours all that is combustible.
But

All love like all fire needs not only ventilation but replenishing:

Unless the primal spark is nourished it will not glow;

Stifle love and it dies down.  So

Even the love of a married pair unless it retains something of the
romance of courtship is apt to go out.

* * *

Love takes no though of surroundings: an empty compartment is as good as
a coppice.  Give it privacy it is satisfied.

* * *

In love we would much rather give than take.  Yet if the giving is
one-sided there is trouble.  And

Love brooks no half measures.  Again

Trust a woman to calculate the breaking-strain of her lover's heart.  But
she will never let him off with less than the maximum stress.

* * *

When love is dead it is perhaps best soonest buried.

* * *

In astronomy to determine the motions of three bodies mutually
attractive is admittedly difficult.  It is easy compared with the same
problem in love.

* * *

A man's work and a woman's love though to each the sum-total of life
are often things wholly and totally dissociated.

Man the egoist thinks that if the woman loves him by consequence she
will love his work.  It may be but usually non sequitur; for

Few are the women who can understand a man's work:

For thousands of years man has worked in the hunting-field in the
market-place in the camp; for an equal length of time woman has worked by
the cradle by the hearth.  Accordingly

Man has two sides to his nature woman but one:

Man wears one aspect when facing the world; he wears quite another aspect
when facing women;

At their work men are rigid frigid austere sever peremptory
tyrannical downright;

With women . . . . . .Humph!--Wherefore

O strenuous and high-aspiring man in thy work seek not from woman's
love what woman's love cannot give; but set thy face 90 as a flint.
Bethink thee of the fate of Anthony.   For

Man's chief business in the world is: Work.

Woman's chief business in the world is; Love.

Man's love (perhaps just because it is his play-thing not his business)
is more finely tempered than is woman's and takes on a finer edge.  For
this very reason it is the more easily turned and is the less useful.
--It is the pocket-knife not the lancet that is oftener called into
requisition.  Also

Man's love is usually a highly ephemeral affair.

With a man love is like hunger or thirst: he makes a great fuss over it;
he forgets when it is appeased.  Yet

When passion's trance is overpast it is fortunate if affection takes
its place.  So too

In love it is the man who protests; and

That man is fortunate who after marriage has not some dubious
reflections as to whether he has protested over-much.  For

In love it is the man generally who makes a fool of himself.

* * *

Love (like murder) will out.  But

Jill keeps her secret better than Jack.  For

A woman generally controls love: a man is controlled by it.  And
Jill's very power of making-believe to be fancy free exasperates Jack.

* * *

It is a purely feminine ruse to apply a test to love--both her own and
that of her lover--to prove it true.  A man would as soon as think of
applying a match to a powder magazine to prove it combustible.

Love in woman's eyes is the supreme and ultimate arbitrator.  If she is
loved love in her eyes will condone anything--anything.  For

To prefer honor to love is a maxim to women unknown.  With them love IS
honor.  And therefore the maxim is meaningless--and needless.

* * *

It is a sort of legal--or rather charitable--fiction that women should
surrender only to love.  In fact

Do not even the lightest of Laises and Thaises make a show of being
swayed by love? And

No woman by too much love was ever spoiled.  Man remember
that!

* * *

The logic of the emotions differs from the logic of the intellect.  As to
the senses--

Alack-a-day! The senses never reason.

Love sometimes wrecks its barque upon the rocks to prove that they harbor
no mirage.

Love sometimes forgets that it is possible to probe too far.

Love in pursuit of love sometimes vivisects as unconsciously as a
science in pursuit of life.

* * *

Women detect the dawn of love while it is still midnight with a man.
That is to say

A woman knows a man is in love with her long before he is aware of it
himself.  Except perhaps in this once circumstance: when she herself is
in love with somebody else.  And this is a highly important circumstance.

* * *

Wholly to satisfy masculine infatuation is given to no woman.  And
perhaps

Wholly to satisfy feminine caprice is given to no man.  So sometimes

The last refuge of an unrequited love is the belief that love will create
love.  Nothing can be more futile than such a faith.  Yet

Love without hope has its mitigations; but

How alleviate the pain of a love that mistook a simulated love for a true
one?

A simulated love is a contradiction in terms.

Either one loves or one does not that is the conclusion of the whole
matter.

* * *

Love would rather suffer than forget.

Love would give the world to be able to exculpate a languid lover.

A passionate love is perhaps always poignant.

Love disdains pity.

A wounded love carries a scar to the grave.

* * *

In love when honor is lost loss of shame soon follows.  Then indeed the
downward patch becomes precipitous.

* * *

To some love never comes; to some it comes too often; but the same love
never recurs as never a bud opens twice: happy he or she is who gains
bud blossom and fruit.  Since

The sweetest love is that wherein the odorous flower of passion ripens
into the nourishing fruitage of affection.  But

Love requires careful nature.  And

The more exotic the love the more difficult its culture.--True An
orchid may life on air.  Yes; but how torrid and vaporous an air!

Your sturdy mistletoe thrives on the humble apple; a Cattleya requires a
Columbian forest.

* * *

Youth wonders at the amatory successes of middle-age.  Youth knows not
that

In matters amatory age is no handicap:

A girl in her 'teens will make love to a gentleman of forty--and vice
versa.  In fact

The indiscreet impetuosity of youth succumbs before the astuteness of
age.

The bachelor and the spinster both sometimes wonder that the benedick and
the bride are still their rivals; for they know not that

In the amatorial art matrimony is no handicap.  In short

There is no barrier at which love will balk.  Nay more

Love will forgive anything:

Did love demand it love though it might blush would not blench.  And

Often love itself stands amazed at its own divine audacity.  Indeed

Love loves to immolate itself for love.  Knowing that

To love nothing is common or unclean: for

Love like charity thinketh no evil.  But--remember that

It is only the Uranian Aphrodite (5) that dares essay a divine audacity.
Nevertheless

Love is the most vulnerable of the emotions and

A love doubtful of itself would be cautiously accepted: it is not a fact
that

To try to feel one's own pulse is to make the heart beat irregularly?
So

To try to see in a mirror the love light in one's own eyes is to be-dim
it.  So too

If passion is not linked with affection--woe worth the day when the
troth was plighted! But given passion linked with affection--ah!

Nothing nothing is criminal to love; for love knows not conscience.  Or
rather

Love upsets all conventional conditions.  For

Love creates a world of its own a world populated by two--and these
make their own laws--or make none.  So

A woman will imbrue her hands with blood and a man will fling honor to
the winds and yet the twain regard each other as impeccant and
impeccable.--Till Pippa passes; then

Love always awakes to the fact that not even a community of two can live
without law; and that

Though human laws may be outraged those divine may not.  And assuredly

The ideal love is the divine love.  And in ideal love

Strange strange but true in a great and ardent love when at last that
is offered which was long sought there supervenes upon the lovers a
great tenderness which hesitates to make their own that for which they
yearned.  Almost it were as if

A psychic monitor warned the conqueror to be clement and the captive to
be kind.  This

Tenderness is the worship of the soul by the soul.  And

Of all tests of love tenderness is the truest.  But indeed indeed

In love there are heights above heights depths beneath depths: who shall
scale them who shall plumb?

(5) See Plato Symposium 180 et seq.

V. On Lovers

Si vis amari ama.
--Seneca


Lovers think the world was made for them.--And so perhaps it was.

* * *

To each other lovers are the most interesting personages alive; but
onlookers regard them partly with amusement partly with pity partly
with compassion--in the etymological sense of that word.

* * *

The first wonder of every accepted lover is that he should be the
accepted lover of such a woman. --What the woman thinks . . . what the
woman thinks probably not even she herself knows.   Probably each woman
thinks her own thoughts.

To doubt whether one is in love is to prove oneself out of it.

* * *

To impress upon the lover the still-existing necessity of refining gold
or painting the lily is out of the question.  Yet every woman attempts
it.

* * *

If there is one proverb more distasteful than another to a
hot-headed lover it is that half a loaf is better than no bread.

*  * *

Children dogs and old people are difficult to deceive.  Lovers who have
to use circumspection should remember this.

* * *

A doubting lover should mark how and for whom his woman dresses.

* * *

To die for a woman would perhaps to a young and ardent lover not be
difficult; to wage incessant warfare with the world for her that perhaps
is not so easy.  But it is the better test of love; and perhaps also the
better preserver and replenisher of love.  For

Little as people seem to be aware of it love requires constant
replenishing: no flame can burn without a feeding oil no pool overflow
with out a purling brook.  Yet

The first ecstasies of love often blind both lover and lass to the care
necessary for the nurture of love.  Indeed

To many treat love as if it were a passing whim; whereas in sober reality
it is  (or should be) a lasting emotion.

* * *

Love with woman is like the tides.  And

Few women know the high-water mark of their love: they are always
harboring the belief that it may rise still higher; and often they await
that rise.

* * *

It is but the reflection of himself in his mistress that many a foolish
lover loves.

* * *

That aged spinster is a rare one who does not regret she did not accept
one of her lovers.  But

That younger spinster is not to be envied who has to make choice of
several.

Youth glories in the multiplicity of its lovers; age sometimes wishes it
had had but one.

* * *

The unloved think lad the one thing needful.  The beloved know that an
ocean of love could be swallowed up and the parched soul cry out athirst.


* * *

It is not well either to confide or confess too much.

A very small rock will wreck a very big ship and a very small slip will
spoil a very long life.

* * *

The pain which lovers cause each other--through fickleness languidness
jealousy and the thousand natural shocks that love is heir to--is not
altogether pain though at the moment it may seem the most poignant
anguish the human soul could suffer.  One proof of this lies in the fact
that

There are few who would choose to have missed love's pangs altogether.

Perhaps the pleasure intermixed with love's pangs arises from the thought
that the other is the cause of our suffering.   For

In all love it is the sacrifice of oneself for the other that brings
keenest joy.  And yet

There is an element of self-love in the very extremest of love.  Since

Love after all is a debtor and creditor affair.  (Who ever loved with
no hope of return?) It is when one of the parties declares him-or
her-self insolvent that the account is closed--with many tears and sighs
on the part of the chief creditor.  At all events

The intenser the love the more flawless does its object appear.  For

The surest test of the sincerity of love is that it thinketh no evil.

The surest test of a waning love is that it begins not to content itself
when it sees its object suffer.

The surest test of a dead love is that it forgets how to be jealous.

* * *

The falling-out of lovers true is a renewing may be of love. (1) Still it
is not to be recommended.  In fact it might be said that

Every falling-out of lovers true is a nail in love's coffin.  Yet

A blessing it is that in love we remember the sweet rather than the
bitter.  For

Love was ever bitter-sweet (2).

(1) Amanitum irae amoris integratis est.
   --Terrence Andria III 23.

(2) But I supposed innumerable people have said this before.  No matter.

* * *

The heart of a lover is like that bottom of a well: all the beauties of
the starry heavens are revealed in it; but when it sheds the light of its
countenance upon it all else is obliterated.

* * *

Was any lover ever loved enough? Or

Did any ever hear of a tired lover? Nevertheless often

Drink to me only with thine eyes says the youthful lover; but when the
seance is over he goes out and orders beef-steak and bottled beer.

* * *

What it really craves the lover's heart is impotent to express.  Yet it
is ever attempting.

A lover is full of wishes as an egg is full of meat.  But

What it really wishes no lover seems able to say.  As a matter of fact

The endless task which the lover is ever attempting is a search for a
formula for the summation of an infinite series of which love is the
variable.--Few lovers seem to understand this.

* * *

To kindle aspiration in her lover a woman herself need not be aspiring.
For

Whatever the talents of a man they are stimulated by contact with woman.
Since

An elevating influence seems to radiate from women: we have but to come
into the light of their countenances for our own faces to shine as the
sun.  Indeed

Physicists may talk as they like but lovers know a more subtle and a
more potent force than any yet revealed to them.  It has not yet been
named; but for the present it might be called psychicity. (3)

(3) Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes speaks of celebricity. See Over the Tea
Cup

* * *

If you wish to ascertain the relationship of a youthful pair watch their
eyes. For

Simulation is difficult to the eye.

* * *

When the idol into which a woman has converted her lover is dethroned
she still worships her remembrance of her god and puts together and
treasures the broken pieces.

When the idol into which has converted his loved one is dethroned he
generally changes his creed.

* * *

A circumpsecting lover is a woman's abhorrence:  as a calculating
mistress is a man's.

* * *

Let a lover but put himself into the hands of his mistress and he is
safe.  Since

The man she really loves a woman will shield through thick and thin
through right and wrong.  For

Concerning a man the only question a woman asks is not Is he right or
wrong? but Is he mine or another's?--We men therefore

Leave a woman to get her lover out of a scrape.

* * *

It is to be feared that the men and women who love but once and forever
are not usually to be found outside of romances.

With women love is a river ever-flowing from the brook in girlhood
(4) to the estuary of womanhood.  Like a river too

Woman's love is fed by all the streams it meets.  On the other hand

With man love is a geyser.

(4) Standing with reluctant feet
    Where the brook and river meet.
  --Longfellow Maidenhood

* * *

The languishing lover has gone out of date; he has been replaced by the
diverting one.  And the change is significant of much:
The early nineteenth-century maid pretended to ignorance; the early
twentieth-century maid to omniscience.

The early nineteenth-century suitor protested; but

The early twentieth-century suitor has to contest.  In the one case

The woman tacitly acknowledges an inequality.  In the other case

The man has to openly to recognize his equal.  Nevertheless

The fundamental relationship between the sexes do not materially vary
from century to century much as conventional manners and customs may.
For after all

Always what a man seeks in a woman is: love.  And

In all love there is something perfectly and Paradisiacally pristine.

Would the most emancipated woman have love otherwise? At all events

Perhaps the most womanly position a woman can occupy is: with her head on
her lover's heart.  At this the strong-minded may scoff.  They may.
* * *

The obsession of the male heart by one woman ousts from it all other
women.  Thus

The accepted young man regards all women but the one as he would regard
fashion-plates.  To the young woman men continue to be men.  That is to
say

A man dives headlong into love.  A woman paddles into it.  And the
woman's hesitation at the brink of the stream exasperates the spluttering
man.  In short

A man's heart is captured wholly and at a stroke.  A woman's heart
surrenders itself piecemeal.

Whereas with a man a trivial passion is usually an affair more of the
senses or of the imagination than of the heart; with a woman every
passions is an affair of the heart.

A man when first he is in love is absorbed in the contemplation of the
object of his love.  A woman is similarly situated is capable of making
comparisons.

It gives to woman's curiosity a curious pleasure to compare the methods
of men's proposals.

In love a woman is generally cool enough to calculate pros and cons; a
man in similar plight is incapable of anything but folly.

* * *

It is a feminine motto that a woman needs to be taught how to love.
Perhaps she does; but most men will think one private tutor ought to
suffice and that tutor ought to be he.  At all events

The last schoolmaster would be apt to regard with somewhat mixed feelings
the tuition of previous crammers.

Why go to the trouble of explaining away a first love if the second is
no whit its inferior? Unless it be to overcome.

What a second love chiefly deplores is: that it was not he (or she) who
first taught his (or her) loved one to love.  Is it not true also that

It is the first love that amazes that beautifies that consecrates?

(An illicit love beautifies and consecrates nothing:

A Maud leaves the daisies rosy; not so Faustine.)

Many a woman has given her heart to one lover and herself to another.
The first is always won; the second is sometimes extorted.  Yet

It is wonderful how a woman will contrive to make all her lovers believe
they are winners.

* * *

It often gives a lady a pleasure to give her lover a pang.

* * *

Not many but have tasted the bitterness of the conflict between the
desire of the flesh and the resentment of the spirit. Explain these terms
who may.

* * *

To attempt by erring to cure an erring lover is to administer not an
antidote but an adjuvant.  It works poison in the blood.
When (and if) in a tortuous love a man arrives at a 'Don't give a damn'
stage he is not to be classed with the animals known as docile.  And as
to a woman. . . . . . . but polite language has its limits.

* * *

Many a man has be exasperated not only by the audacity of his rival but
by the equanimity with which his lady-love views that audacity.  He
forgets that as a rule

Feminine complaisance varies directly as masculine audacity.  And yet
often enough as a simple matter of fact 118 Masculine diffidence is
vastly more potent than masculine audacity.  And further

Rarely need the complaisance that audacity evokes perturb the diffident
man; since

Rarely need the complaisance that audacity evokes perturb the diffident
man; since

The true woman may give her fingertips to the gallant; she gives herself
to the worshiper.  The pity o' it is that

The worshiper cannot away with the complaisance that permits a woman to
give even her finger-tips to the gallant.  And

Few are the women who have plumbed the silent and sensitive depths of the
diffidence of her devotee.  The worst of it is

The devotee essays two things: he would apotheosize the object of his
adoration and place her as a constellation among the stars; yet he would
have her at the same time terrestrial and tangible.  When the woman shows
herself terrestrial and tangible to others than he the faith of the
devotee is shaken.  In fine

Every lover attempts that impossible task: the realization of the
heavenly ideal.  Perhaps

It is in aphelion that the corona appears most splendid;

Were perihelion to result is coalescence perhaps the photosphere would
be proved composed of terrestrial vapors.  And if it did (as no doubt it
would) would it be at all bedimmed?  For to the devout astrologer

Nothing nothing will ever destroy beauty--and therefore wonder.  So

Bodily beauty where Love is priestess is a daedal spur to the loftiest
worship.

The lover is ever worshipful. And

Where is worship nothing can be profane.  So

In love there is nor taint nor stain.  Therefore

Make O youthful lover the best and most of youth and love: never will
either recur.

* * *




VI. On Making Love

Mille modi Veneris
--Ovid


There are as many ways of making love as there are of making soup.  And
probably

There are as many kinds of love as there are of flavors.  And

Palates--both sentimental and physical--evidently differ widely.  And
yet

If you would know the secret of success with women it is said in a word:
Ardor.  And

Would ye O women know in a word the secret of success with men? It lies
in: Responsiveness.

* * *

In matters amatory--or rather pre-amatory--feminine tactics are
infallible and consummate:

Let no man think to cope with feminine strategy.

* * *

A rake has more chance than a ninny.--Which doubtless has been said
before.

* * *

In love as in all things indecision spells ruination.  For

There is a curious antagonism between the sexes. They are in a manner
foes not friends.  The successful wooer is the captor the raptor; the
bride is the capture the rapture. (1) And

Even she who is minded to be caught will not spare her huntsman the ardor
of the chase and lightly esteems him who imagines she is to be lightly
won.

In the chess-like game of love-making no woman plays for check-mate: the
game interests her too much to bring it to a finish.  What pleases her
most is stale-mate where though the King cannot be captured the
captress can maneuver without end.

A man imagines he wins by strenuous assault.  The woman knows the victory
was due to surrender.

(1) Etymologically as well as metaphorically--and veritably.

* * *

Wouldst thou ask ought of a woman? Question her eyes: they are vastly
more voluble than her tongue.  Indeed

There is no question too subtle too delicate too recondite or too
rash for human eyes to ask or answer.  And

He who has not learned the language of the eyes has yet to learn the
alphabet of love.  Besides

Love speaks two languages: one with the lips; the other with the eyes.
(There is really a third; but this is Pentecostal.) At all events

Lovers always talk in a cryptic tongue.

There is but one universal language: the ocular--not Volapuk nor
Esperanto is as intelligible or as efficacious as this.

* * *

No woman can be coerced into love--though she may be coerced into
marriage.  And

Man the clumsy wielder of one blunt weapon often enough stands agape at
his own powerlessness before the invulnerable woman of his desire.
Indeed

The battle between the coquettish maid and determined man is like the
battle between the Retiarius and the Mirmillio.  The coquetry ensnares
the man as with a net against which his sword is useless.

* * *

A woman's emotions are as practical as a man's reason.

A man's emotions are never practical.  This is why

In the emotional matter of love men and women so often lash. And perhaps

It is a beneficial thing for the race that a woman's emotions are
practical.  For

If neither the man nor the woman curbed the mettlesome Pegasus Emotion
methinks the colts and fillies would want for hay and oats.
* * *

It is a moot question which is the more fatally fascinating: the
uniformed nurse or the weeded widow.  But

Who has yet discovered the secret springs of fascination? For example

How is it that certain eyes and lips will enthrall while others leave us
cold and inert?

Does the potency lie in the eyes and the lips or is there some
inscrutable and psychic power? At all events who will explain how it is
that

A man will sometimes forsake the most beautiful of wives and a woman will
forsake the kindest of husbands to follow recklessly one who admits no
comparison with the one forsaken? All we can say is that

The potency of personality exceeds the potency of beauty.  For
Powerful as is physical charm it counts not for all in the matter of
love.  Yet what it may be that does count and how and why it does count
no man living shall say.  For

Is even love aware of all its seeks? And

Is it given to any to grant all that love beseeches? And yet

Were all love sought bestowed what sequel?

Perhaps 't were well to leave love but semi-satisfied.  At bottom the
real question is this: What will win and keep me another heart?  But

How to win and keep another heart that is a thing has to be found out
for oneself--if it be discoverable.  And always by the experimental
method.  Since

In matters amatory there is no a priori reasoning possible.  All we know
is that

There is nothing more potent than passion.  And

The chasm which seems to innocence to yawn between virtue and frailty
is leapt by that Pegasus Passion at a bound--but he blinds his rider
in the feat.

* * *

In spite of the poesy of love deeds are more potent than words;
--though perhaps it is well to pave the way for the one by the other.

In spite too of the piety of love love laughs at promises--that is
the promises that affect it.

* * *

There is one miracle that women can always perform and always it
astonishes the man; it is this: to change from the recipient into the
appellant.  That is to say

When woman usually regarded as the receiver becomes the giver--or
rather the demander--man's wonderment surpasses words.  And let it be
remembered that

There is no re-crossing this Rubicon.

* * *

Mistrust a prolonged and obdurate resistance.  Either you are
out-classed or you are out-experienced.  And besides

Surrender after prolonged resistance rarely is brought about by emotion.


* * *

A woman never really quite detests daring.  This is why
Much is a forgiving a daring man.  So too

Much is forgiven a pretty woman by the men.

* * *

If the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water the
beginning of love is as when one kindleth a fire.

* * *

The eye tells more than the tongue.  And

If the eye and the tongue contradict each other believe the eye.

* * *

There is an indifference that attracts and there is an indifference that
repels.  He is a sagacious man and she is a sagacious woman who will
differentiate them.  The question resolves itself into that which so
often puzzles the angler--how much line to let out.  About one thing
there need be no hesitation

When your fish is within reach be quick with the landing-net--or even
with the gaff.

* * *

In the matter of wooing soon enough does the young girl learn to prefer
the mature manners of the man of the world to the gaucheries of
inexperienced youth.  As to the man!

How curious the things that appeal to this lord of creation Man!--a
half-averted face--a laughing gesture--a merry eye--an all but
imperceptible tone of the voice--the scarce felt touch of a reluctant
hand--a semi-tender phrase--an unexpected glance--the momentary
pressure of petulant lips--a blanched cheek--a look prolonged one
fractional part of a second beyond its wont--an infinitesimal drooping
of the eyelid--a speaking silence--a half-caught sigh--these will
entrap the male brute where green widths that were never dried will not
hold him. But

By what men are won most women seem thoroughly to comprehend.

By what women are won few men know.  Perhaps

No woman knows by what she herself is won.

One thing there is at all events to which woman will always succumb:
tenderness.  But remember Dames that

Tenderness is extremely difficult of simulation.  Or rather

Tenderness is so delicate and deep-seated a feeling that few care to
attempt its simulation.

* * *

A woman who gives herself too freely is apt to regret the giving.  In
time too she discovers that as a matter of fact

No woman can give her real self twice: one or other gift will prove to be
a loan. (And

It is always and only the first recipient that causes a woman's heart to
flutter and often it flutters long.) 144

A second gift is generally a mortgage--if it is not a sale.

A mortgage is difficult to bind. For

There is a statute of limitations in love as there is in law.  Nor is the
former to be set aside by bond.

That pair is in a parlous state when either party discovers that the
title was not properly searched.  Since

Everybody expects a fee simple--though few deserve it God wot!

* * *

Perhaps the most durable conquest is the incomplete one.  Which sounds
illogical. But it is well to remember that

Repletion seems to cause in the man temporary indifference; while

Repletion causes in the woman enduring content.  And in this we can
detect a significant distinction between the sexes: namely the fact that

A single goal satisfies most women;

No single goal ever yet satisfied the restless spirit of man.

* * *

What gives keenest joy is the evocation of latent passion.  For
Each takes pleasure in believing that he or she alone can evoke this
passion.  Accordingly

The premature confession of passion and the confession of premature
passion both rankle in the breast--and probably in the breast of both
penitent and confessor.

* * *

What intensity of feeling a woman can throw into the enunciation of a
Christian name! There is perhaps no better clue to possession that this.
For probably

Not until a man's Christian mane is ecstatically uttered is a woman
wholly his.
* * *

Men and women content with the different weapons.  This is why
Men are rarely intrepid in the presence of women; but women rarely stand
in awe of men.--Nothing differentiates the sexes more than this; but
the psychological reason is difficult to discover.  Perhaps

The making of love is a sort of duel the conditions of which are that
the man shall doff all his armor and the woman may don all hers.  Indeed

The battle of love-making would be an unequal combat even were both
contestants fully panoplied; for

A woman's derision will pierce any mail.  In fact

No armor is impervious to woman's shafts--be they those of laughter or
be they those of love.  So

The veriest rou' is vulnerable to the veriest maid.  But

For each man she meets a woman carries in her quiver but one shaft.  If
that misses its aim she is powerless: it is like a dart without a thong;
when thrown the man can close.  But

Always it devolves upon the man to take the initiative.  But again

Always the man must pretend that he takes no initiative.  But again

Always the woman must pretend that she gives no opportunity.

The game of love is not only one of chance but one of skill.
What irks man is that a woman pretends that she must be circumvented by
wiles.  But

Man was ever a clumsy wooer.  Nevertheless

It is only the man who thinks he is too venturesome.   Since

The iciest woman sometimes thaws.  And

The austerer a woman the sweeter her surrender.  And again
A woman is never sweeter than in surrender.  Accordingly

De l'audace et encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace(2) should
be the motto of every wooer.  Since

Audacity if beloved of women; but it must be an audacity born of
Sincerity and educated b y Discretion.  At all events

Beware timidity--it is fatal.

(2) Danton

* * *

With women nothing is more conquering than conquest; nothing so
irresistible as resistance.  On the other hand

Resistance on the part of the woman is an effort put forth for the
purpose of defeating its own object.

* * *

A man prizes only what he has fought for.  No one knows this better than
a woman.  This is why

A woman's capitulation she always makes to appear as a capture.  And

Where there are no defense works a woman will erect them.

Foolish that man who does not storm entrenchments. For

Resistance on the part of a woman is a wall which a man is expected to
leap.  His agility is the measure of her approbation.

* * *

Arouse a woman's interest and you arouse much.  But
Having failed disappear.  Yet

It takes very many futile attempts to make a failure.  At the same time

Importunity is an inferior weapon.

* * *

A conditional surrender is no surrender.  But

A woman's surrender is in reality a desertion a going over to the enemy.
Thenceforward she is an ally.  Indeed

A woman's capitulation is her conquest.

* * *

Let no amount of simulated austerity deter you. The marble Galatea came
to life at the prayer of a man.

* * *

The number of modes in which a woman can say 'Yes' has not up to the
present be accurately enumerated; but perhaps the one most frequently in
use is the negative imperative.  And

Many are the men who have puzzled long and painfully over the motives of
a woman's 'No.' Yet in nine cases out of ten a woman says 'No' merely
because she feels herself on the brink of saying 'Yes'. In other words

It is often mistrust of herself that leads many a woman to refuse it will
the lips the consent that is fluttering at her heart.  Perhaps that is
why

With woman 'Yea' and 'Nay' are meaningless and interchangeable terms.

* * *

'Ware a show of excessive feeling.  It is proof either that it is
shallow and evanescent or that it is put on.  At all events
Excessive feeling is rarely taken seriously.  Now

Seriousness adds a spice to gallantry. But like spice a little is
ample.

* * *

Many men think it is the woman who has to be persuaded.  It is not the
woman; it is her scruples.  Besides Nemo repente turpissimus--vel
turpissima.  Yet

By thirty scruples are either dormant or dominant.

Both of the callow youth of fifteen and the man of the world of
forty-five swear by the woman of thirty.

* * *

It may seem a paradox but it is a truism that in matters of love it
is the weaker and the defenseless sex that takes the initiative.  In
other words

The woman makes the opportunity which the man takes.  And

An opportunity missed is an opportunity lost.  And

The woman is implacable to the man who sees the opportunity and takes it
not.  Since

With woman indifference is worse than insult.  Wherefore

Never never disappoint a woman.

* * *

Spontaneous admiration is the sincerest flattery.  Those who know this
affect spontaneity.  But it requires much art to conceal this art.

You will oftener err upon the side of ultra-delicacy in a compliment that
upon the side of bare-facedness.

Do not imagine that excessive admiration can give offence.  But remember
that

The eye can netter express admiration than can the tongue.

The publicity with which a woman will receive admiration from a
male admirer 144 often is sufficient to astonish that admirer.  But

Often enough it is the admiration not the admirer that a woman covets.
Indeed

Many a woman is in love with love (3) but not her lover. But this no
lover can be got to comprehend.

To flatter by deprecating a rival is a complement of extremely doubtful
efficacy.

(3) I seem to remember that somebody before has said something like this
before.

* * *

A woman does not admire too clement a conqueror.  She admits the right to
ovation  and to him who waives it she lightly regards.

* * *

Seek no stepping-stones unless you mean to cross:

He who gathers stepping-stones and refrains from crossing is contempted
of women.  Indeed

Every advance of which advantage is not taken is in reality a retreat.
And remember too that though

Sought interviews are sweet those unsought are sweeter.  And

Probably no son of Adam--and for the matter of that probably no
daughter of Eve--ever quite looks back with remorse upon a semi-innocent
escapade.  Yet

The man who thinks he can at any time extract himself from any feminine
entanglement that he may choose to have raveled is a simpleton.

* * *

The way of man with a maid may have been too wonderful for Agur;
now-a-days the way of a man with a married woman would puzzle a wiser
than he.

What is the attitude to be maintained towards the too complaisant spouse
of an honorable friend? That is a problem will puzzle weak men without
end.  Of that fatal and fateful dilemma when a wife or a husband falls
victim to the wiles of another there are for the delinquent two and
only two horns (and it is a moot question upon which it is preferable to
be impaled): Flight--either from the victor or the victrix.  Yet

To some it is no anomaly to pray God's blessing upon a liaison.  But
these folk are to be pitied; for

A clandestine love always works havoc--havoc to all three. (4)

(4) Cf. Platus: Malus clandestinus est amor; damnum 'st merum.

Will men and women never learn what trouble they lay up in store for
themselves by breaking their plighted troths?

* * * * *




VII. On Beauty

La beaute' pour moi c'est la divinite' visible c'est le bonheur
palpable c'est le ciel descendu sur terre.
--Theophile Gautier


Beauty they say is but skin-deep.  That is quite deep enough to enslave
mankind.  As a matter of fact it is much deeper: for to say nothing of
health and good-spirits

Beneath true beauty lies an admirable or a loveable character.   And
yet--or perhaps and therefore--

If by some mischance beauty should arouse our resentment with what
different eyes we regard it!

* * *

The feeling for beauty is probably more highly developed in man than in
woman.  (N. B. Perhaps this is the source of the beauty of women.)
Nevertheless

It is a question that perhaps will never be settled how much value
should be placed upon mere beauty. For

Man soon tires of mere beauty.  In fact man the inconstant creature
soon tires of mere anything.

* * *

Beauty should never be analyzed.  At sight of graceful neck who speaks
of musculus sterno-cleido-mastoideus; at touch of moist red lips who
thinks upon the corpuscles of Paccini?

* * *

More women are wooed for their complexions than for their characters.

* * *

Could women only know it nothing can add to their charms: how
provokingly delightful is the uniformed demureness of an hospital nurse
beside the elaborate bedizenments of a woman of fashion!

* * *

The most beautiful thing known among men is: a good woman.  And this is
not an anomaly.

* * *

She who captures a man by a single charm be it even beauty holds him by
a weak chain.

Think not it was merely beauty that made Helen or Cleopatra historic.

Beauty is much and grace is much; but there is a charm more subtle and
potent than these.

* * *

Beauty without modesty is a rose without perfume: the petals may delight
but they lack an ineffable savor.  Like a flower too

Though the tangible petals are numbered and comptable the subtle perfume
eludes the sense and is inexhaustible.  For

Modesty is the exhalation of the soul: at once it enhances as it
refines the potency of beauty.  Nay more

The sacrosanct aureole of modesty beautifies all it surrounds: though it
diviner haze imperfection there is none.  So

Given a redolent balm and the lowliest herb becomes treasured and
precious.  And

Each human soul has its own individual essence;

What folly were the violet to envy the rose! Since

Beauty is much and grace is much and mien and demeanor and wit; but a
prepotent and psychic essence there is transcending the power of these.
And

As the suave and subtle essence is not distinct from but springs from
the tangible and numerable petals so the spirit perceives that its
fleshy vesture is not a thing apart to be donned or doffed at will to b
e contemned or left out of regards but indeed at integral and
inseparable portion of itself; for

In the very woof and warp of flesh sprit is immanent and enmeshed.
Indeed--though in a mystic sense--

Vesture and wearer are mutually one.  And yet

Love ever essays the task of seeking out the psychic wearer beneath the
corporeal vesture--often with plaintive strife.

When seeker and sought make a mutual search--the starkest strife is
condoned.  But alack!

The mystic unity of the human soul is never wholly divulged--not even to
love--not even to love.

* * * * *




VIII. On Courtship

Un amant fait la court ou s'attache son coeur.
--Moliere


A woman really in love and sure of her lover delights in toying with a
sort of coquetry of love; as if it pleased her to try to win over again
that the winning of which gave so exquisite a pleasure.  And perhaps

The coquetry of love is the surest test of an unquestionable love.  For

When possession can afford to play at pursuit this but proves possession
complete. Sometimes

An assumed love will resort to the pretty tricks of a real one in order
to assure its object--or to re-assure itself.

Surrender after a protracted siege has its advantages.  At all events
both M and N can look back to more demi-semi happy incidents when the
courtship has been long.

Happy that couple can laugh over the incidents of courtship afterwards.
'T is a portent of impending ill if they cannot.

* * *

Half-heartedness in courtship is not only suicidal it is murderous.  On
the other hand remember that

In courtship there are various and varying stages. But there is always
the home-gallop.  Remember too that

What is suitable at one stage of courtship is ruinous at another. And

It is only the old whip who knows when to push the pace:

In courtship to force the running is hazardous.  Though we win the
victory loses its sweets.  And

In courtship men too often ride on the snaffle; in matrimony too often
on the curb.

* * *

Courtship asks for cash payment.  Matrimony has often to allow unlimited
credit.  Insolvency is not unknown.

* * *

In courtship all auxiliaries but the rival.  No one will impede a lover
save another lover.

* * *

In the presence of a woman man is by nature a diffident animal. The
women who recognize this are often the most successful. Indeed

Many are the refined and gentle women who in after life regret that they
did not more openly cope with their less delicately-minded sisters.
Nevertheless

Nothing is more astonishing than a woman's tact in encouraging a man.

* * *

In courtship modulated and musical tones count for much.  Who with harsh
speech would assail a lady's ear?

* * *

No woman thinks she can be wooed too often.  And

Few women can forgo an opportunity to fascinate.

* * *

In courtship the woman is the whole world to the man; in matrimony the
man is the whole world to the woman.

* * *

In courtship the slightest suspicion of condescension is fatal.  For

True love is a greater leveler than anarchy.

* * *

In courtship the wooer to the wooed is in Juliet's phrase the god of
her idolatry; in matrimony he is lucky if he is the idol of her deity.

* * *

It is a question which is the sweeter: a spontaneous courtship or one
that has sprung from friendship.

In a spontaneous courtship there is all the charm of novelty;

In a courtship that has grown out of affection there is all the
trustfulness of friendship.  But

Friendship and courtship are two totally distinct things:

In courtship men and women meet on the flowery-thorny common of love;

In friendship men and women invite each other over to their respective
plots.  So

A friend will show a friend all over his domain;

A lover can but point out to the lover the flowers (and thorns) which
grow in the soil to which they are both strangers.  162

* * *

It is an open question whether in matters pre-matrimonial the mode of
the French is not preferable to that of the Anglo-Saxon; whether that
is

Prudence and prevision are not more certain harbingers of matrimonial
happiness of matrimonial happiness than are impulse and passion.

The French couple when wedded are virtually strangers; the Anglo-Saxon
have already together enacted some scenes of the matrimonial drama.  Yet
it is an open question also whether

A more durable domestic affection is not built up from the pristine
foundation of total ignorance than from that of a partial
acquaintanceship.

The American Elizabeth Patterson before she became Madame Jerome
Bonaparte could write I love Jerome Bonaparte and I prefer to be his
wife were it only for a day to the happiest union.

The continentalized Madame Jerome Bonaparte twenty-six years after she
had ceased to be Miss Elizabeth Patterson could write Do we not know
how easily men and women free themselves from the fetters of love and
that only the stupid remain caught in these pretended bonds? (1) After
all

Little do any couple know of each other before marriage.  Besides
Does not a delightful romance envelope the nuptials of strangers? At all
events even if precaution is a foe to impulse few will be found to deny
that

Strangeness is by no means inimical to passion.  Perhaps then
Fathers and mothers and uncles and aunts can form a better judgment as to
the suitability and adaptability to each other of two young ardent and
headstrong boys and girls can these themselves; since

Fathers and mothers and uncles and aunts know full well that impulse and
passion often prove materials too friable for the many-storied fabric of
marriage.  At all events

The French mode of contracting a marriage precludes the possibility of
perilous and precocious affairs of the heart.  Perhaps

The mistake that ardent and headstrong boys and girls make is in thinking
that impulse and passion are the keys of Paradise. Their
Elders know that impulse and passion are sometimes the keys of Purgatory.

Prudence and prevision are not keys to any supernal (or infernal)
existence; they are merely guide-books to a terrestrial journey. At all
events it is significant that (which might be added as a lemma)

Widows rarely choose unwisely!

(1) Quoted by C. de Varigny in the Revue des Deux Mondes of January the
15th 1893.

* * *

Over that much-bethought-of much-surmised-about-thing a proposal of
marriage every young woman weaves a pre-conceived halo of romance but

In nineteen cases out of twenty a proposal is either unexpected or
disappointing; that is

Many a girl has almost held her breath with anxiety as she saw the great
question coming; then almost cried with vexation at the way it came.
For often

Either the wrong man proposes or the right man proposes stupidly.

The woman looks for ideal surroundings a dramatic situation and
impassioned and poetic utterance; usually

The man seizes a commonplace opportunity and--stutters. Probably

The ideal proposal occurs only in novels.  And yet--and yet--

Perhaps after all the real proposal is more complimentary to woman than
is the ideal; at least perhaps

The aberration and obfuscation of the man is proof once (i) of her
potency and (ii) of his sincerity.

Did man keep his head would woman be quite so sure of his heart? Yet it
may be that in these matter woman is liable to err since

Rarely if ever does a woman's heart run away with her head.  When it
does--

Ah! the momentary bliss of an unreasoning emotion! Yet

Woman does right to keep her head for

Almost every woman's happiness depends upon what she does with her
heart--unless indeed she elects to go through life homeless childless
and unenspoused; for

Though it is the wife that makes the home it is the man who must provide
for it.  And since

Man by nature is probably nomadic and polygamic; not his to debate
whether to give rein to emotion.  Woman by nature is in far different
case:

For the sake of her child woman must bind the nomad to herself.
Accordingly

It is woman who is the true agglutinator and civilizer of society.
Therefore it comes about that

To order wisely her emotions is the inherited instinct of woman.
Wherefore

Woman is the conserver of the nation--and this in more senses than one.

* * * * *




IX. On Men and Women

Dio fa gli uomini e e' s' appaino.
--Salviati


There are two elements of character which a man should possess develop
and maintain unstained if he would find favor in feminine eyes: the first
is bravery; the second indomitableness of resolution.  So likewise

There are two elements of character which a woman should possess
develop and maintain unstained if she would find favor in masculine
eyes: the first is sympathy; the second sweetness of temper.

* * *

A curious and latent hostility divides the sexes.  It seems as they could
not approach each other without alarums and excursions.  Always the
presence of the one rouses anxiety in the breast of the other; they stand
to arms; they resort to tactics; they maneuver.  And

Men and women approach each other vizored and in armor.  But it is often
only to conceal the craven heart that beats beneath the brazen cuirass.

* * *

Men judge of women not so much by their intrinsic worth as by the
impression women make upon them.  And women know this since
All women are alive to the fact that the impressing (1) of men is the
important function of life.  Accordingly

Great stress is and is naturally laid by women upon dress and the
subtleties of the toilette.  For

In matters of the heart man is led by the heart and not by the head. (2)
And why not? Since

It is generally a sweet-heart not a hard head that a man wants. In
short

Men are oftener vanquished by a look than by logic; by a gracious smile
than by good sense; by manner and even by dress than by mental
development or depth.  This is to say

A man judges a woman by her appearance;

A woman judges a woman by her motives. (And

A woman judges of a woman's motives by what she knows of her own.)--So
it comes about that

To a man a woman's heart is something mysterious.  But

Women who know their own hearts have little difficulty in reading
others'.

(1) It is (perhaps) highly unfortunate that to this word is attached a
two-fold signification.

(2) Though as Mr. Grant Allen has endeavored to show this is a
scientific a method as any.

* * *

No units of measurement yet devised are adequate for the computation of
the power wielded by a beautiful woman.

* * *

That is a significant fact and probably could we fathom all the
profundities and unravel all the entanglements of the relations between
the sexes as deep and as intricate as significant that no woman thinks
a man can pay her a higher compliment than to wish to make her his own.
For though

Woman thinks man her ultimate aim and desire Nature knows that man is
but the stepping-stone to the child.  In the end woman agrees with
Nature. We may go farther and say

Women are nearer the eternal laws than are men.  Men govern themselves by
the laws they themselves make. Women are lawless. Laws are for the
temporal the fleeting; for a given individual in a given society; for a
particular race in a particular clime.  Such laws are obeyed by women
only under compulsion.  They more far-seeing than men instinctively
peer far beyond the ephemeral rules manufactured by men into the realm
of laws eternal and immutable; these she obeys implicitly
unquestioningly--much to man's amazement--and it may be his
mortification; for he sees that she is freer than he.  This is why

For the man she truly loves a woman will sacrifice everything
--everything.  The same generous sentiment cannot by any means be
attributed to man.

* * *

Both the wise man and the wise woman--but here I am reminded of the
recipe for hare soup.

* * *

Between the sexes there is in reality but one link--the link amatory.
And

So long as Nature maintains two sexes so long will men and women hug
yet chafe under that slender but invisible bond.

Not even Cupid and Psyche avoided a misunderstanding--in spite of the
devotion of the other.  And

If men and women differ in matters amatory it is because men and women
have trodden different evolutionary paths:

The man given up to the chase (for pelts or pelf) and careful of his
status in the tribe thinks only of himself and the present;

The woman her sole care the nurture of her offspring thinks only of her
progeny and the future.   But since

The family is the unit of the state therefore

The state makes laws not for love but for the family.

Happy that family the parents of which are bound by cosmic not by
municipal affection.  Nevertheless

Say what one will  Love scoffs at laws; howsoever marriage and divorce
may be regulated by parliamentary statute.

Man as a member of a political community may make marriage laws to suit
that community--laws to suit that community--laws de vinculo
matrimonii and laws de mensa et thoro decrees nisi prius and
decrees absolute; but

Law can no more bind the affections than it can bind the sweet influences
of the Pleiades.  And yet at bottom

Beneath all municipal and parochial regulations a great and cosmic law
does govern the relations of the sexes; and

The lightest whim of the lightest lady has a definite perhaps a cosmic
fount and origin.

* * *

A man can never know too much. Perhaps a woman can.  And

It is a question how far a man admires a woman who knows too much.  For

If there is nothing a man can teach a woman not even of the ways of
love the man is apt to be chagrined.  Besides

Too much knowledge is inimical to romance.

* * *

War is a man's true trade; love woman's.

* * *

There is no stronger argument against the equality of the sexes than a
woman's hand.  It was made to toil? No; to place in her lover's.  In
truth

Is there anything more fragile in nature than a woman's hand? But put it
in her lover's. and what a force it has!

Anomaly of anomalies with women fragility delicacy dependence
beauty grace--it is by these weak weapons that she wins.  So

We watch a demure damsel of some sixteen sunny summers much as we watch a
delicate dynamo of some thousand kilowatts.

Both seem so calm so quiescent.  Yet both we know can generate such
startling energy can bring about such marvelous results.

* * *

Many women forget that things which men have no objection to their female
friends doing they often have a very particular objection to their
mothers sisters and wives doing.  So too they often forget that

It is not the girl he flatters compliments and is conspicuously
attentive to that the man always marries.  Perhaps this goes to show
that

There is a deeper and more serious current in the flow of male emotions
which much as light and fitful breezes may stir the surface is moved
only by and mingles only with a similar and confluent stream.  For

It is not man's highest instincts that are stimulated by the more
superficial of feminine blandishments; though no doubt many a man there
is has been made permanently captive by their lure.  The truth is that

Man is a many-sided creature: he will reflect many different rays; but it
is only under the ray that pierces the surface and irradiates the
interior that he truly glows.

* * *

Woman does not lean upon man because she is inferior but rather because
she is his supporter; just as

The buttress leans upon the building; but the building would fall without
the buttress.  That is

Woman's dependence upon man is his chief source of strength.  Those who
cannot understand this may be left to their ignorance.
* * *

It is not all women who comprehend the exaltation of mind into which some
men are thrown by their presence.  Indeed

Men put a higher value upon a woman's complaisance than she does herself.
To a women feminine concession appear trivial.  Is it any wonder then
that

Woman calls man's jealousy unreasonable? In reality

The affianced man thinks he has gotten him an angel from heaven.  It is
not within the bounds of mortal male comprehension that such an angel
should sully her wings.

* * *

Women know their sex.--Which if it is a truism is a truism that men
often forget.  And

Few things permit a man to see so far into the subtleties and intricacies
of feminine hearts as a squabble between two of them over himself.

* * *

A man in defeat generally turns to woman.  A woman in defeat is either
scornful silent or both.

A man in depression falls back upon his only weapon: brute force.  A
woman in like circumstances does the same.  But her weapon is personal
charm.

* * *

In matters amatory and maternal a woman will risk more than will a man.
In fact

In matters amatory and maternal woman is the truly combative animal.

* * *

Many are the members of the one sex that are entrapped by the wiles of
the other; but it often happens that the entrapper afterwards rues the
capture as much as--or even more than--the entrapped.  So it often
happens that

Girls who are deliberately seeking husbands think love may be won by
artifice.  Not until well on in years do

Women know that by men love and artifice are considered mortal foes.

To win him a wife by artifice would be to a man a thing impossible and
abhorrent: yet

To win her a husband by artifice is to a woman a thing quite natural.
But

When (if ever) the man discovers that he was won by artifice there are
apt to be several bad quarters of an hour.  For when all is said and
done

The man free and easy thoughtless and untrammeled knowing he may pick
and choose never chooses till--till--there comes the woman he thinks
he wants.  Then he says point blank he wants her.
Should it ever be revealed to him that his Want was the result of her
Artifice a very different complexion is put upon that Want.  On the
other hand

The woman deprived of the power of choice trammeled by convention
bound to wait till asked for quite naturally resorts to artifice.  And
yet curiously enough and a thing incomprehensible by man

A man whom a woman has won by sheer artifice she can love to the end of
her life.  But after all

What a refuge to man is work--or play! Alas!

Women has no refuge.  So

Men cannot suffer long; women do.

A man flies to work or sport or to the gaming-table or to drink.  A
woman . . . . . .

He who can tell what a woman does in the sorrow of the soul will tell us
much.

Some women in sorrow of soul eat out their hearts in silence; other
women in sorrow of soul will tell us much.
Some women in sorrow of soul eat out their hearts in silence; other
women in sorrow of soul eat out the hearts of others not in silence.
But

Take a taciturn woman seriously.  For always

A taciturn woman has suffered much:

A taciturn woman is a lonely one.  And probably

It is only women who really know loneliness:

Give a man a full meal and an outlet for his energy--he is fairly
contented; for

A man always has friends or a club; women rarely have either.

* * *

The most superb of physical charms are powerless unless fired by
imagination; as the most destructive of explosives is harmless without a
cap or a detonator.  But

Given a detonator and the coarsest powder can work tremendous havoc.

* * *

What precisely will bring a particular man to her feet--that is par
excellence the feminine problem: and many and various are the
experiments by which she tries to resolve it.  And

Few are the men who learn that were won by experiment.  For

Man succumbs to his emotions.  He cannot comprehend how it is that

Into feminine emotion calculation often enters.

* * *

As there are two classes of warriors so there are two classes of women:

There is the warrior who conquers the world from sheer love of conquest--
an Alexander a Genghis Khan an Attila a Napoleon; and there is the
warrior who captures a kingdom for the sake of possession--such is your
Norman William.

So there is the woman whom no conquest contents--Aholibah Cleopatra
Mesalina Faustine; and there is the woman who is happy with a husband
and home--Deborah Vlmnia Calpurnia mother of Gracchi.

* * *

One thing from men women cannot abide and this is a hostile and
REASONABLE attitude.  And naturally since

It is only man's reason that is hostile to women.  And
When a man clothes himself with reason as with a garment woman slinks
away.  And quite naturally:

Reason and emotion are mortal foes; and

It is on the field of emotion that the battle of love must be fought.
For

In the battle of love the woman chooses and entrenches her position; the
man has to act on the offensive.  But

Only emotion can cope with emotion; reason but beats the air.  Wherefore

A wise man will neither oppose nor appeal to a woman through reason.

* * *

Who can penetrate to the motives of a woman's coaxings? Yet
Foolish is the man who questions the motives of a woman's coaxings.  Yet

Not to be sure of a woman's coaxings--not upon this side Phlegethon is
there a more poignant position.

* * *

In loving one woman a man believes in all women.  And

Not till a woman is loved are her finger-tips objects of devoutest
worship.   On the other hand

It cannot be said that in loving one man a woman believes in all men.
Which little distinction is proof perhaps that

Love blinds the eyes of men but opens the eyes of women.  In other
words

Passion obfuscates man's prevision; it does not obfuscate  a woman's.

Man gives the rein to passion or ere he knows whither it leads;

A woman gives the rein to passion only after she has found out whither it
leads.  But when the goal is known perhaps

Women are more implacable votaries of the Implacable Goddess than are
men.  That is the say

A woman keeps her head till she can give her heart then she gives it
utterly;

A man (perhaps because he has no heart) soon enough loses his head.  So

Before the gift a woman's qualms exasperate the man;

After the gift the man's indifference exasperates the woman;

* * *

It is folly to think that love and friendship exhaust the varieties of
human relationships:--

The relationships between earthly souls are as complex and multiform as
those between heavenly bodies.

In one thing does friendship excel love: it is always reciprocal; one
friend presupposes another.  Not so a lover.

Friendship is largely a masculine sentiment;--except among schoolgirls.

The friendship that exists between a man and a woman should be called by
another name.  It cannot be wholly Platonic (3); it need not be wholly
Dantesque. Yet women generally strive to make it the one; and men often
try to make it the other.  And yet again

How many women there be would if they could transmute love into
friendship! That is to say

Women regard a man's friendship as a delicate flattery to themselves; yet
they instinctively know though they try hard to forget that a man's
friendship for a woman is extremely likely to transcend the bounds of
friendship.

If only friendship would keep within bounds! How many women deceive
themselves into thinking that were devoutly to be wished! Yet probably
as a matter of fact

The very woman who avers she regrets that your friendship is not mere
Platonic would resent the Platonism did it exist.  Possibly not every
woman will understand this.  Assuredly no woman will admit it. And yet

It is impossible to conjecture in what an exchange of confidences may
terminate: it may be a kiss or it may be a quarrel.  But

Confidences are evoked rather by friendship than by love:

A woman will tell a man friend what she will not tell a lover.

Few lovers will understand this fewer still will believe it.   Yet it is
true and the explication of its truth would be long and complex.  This
much may be said:

Love idealizes; friendship does not.  At the same time

Love probes the innermost recesses of the womanly nature; and until the
woman is wholly won

The woman resents the inspection of love.  She knows that

To stimulate love the woman must conceal not reveal;

To stimulate love the woman must conceal not reveal.  Furthermore

Never was there a man who could be at once friend and lover.

Which is only one more proof that

Never will the sexes understand each other.

(3) I use the word in its purely conventional sense.

* * *

The male was ever the more susceptible sex.   And for this reason

Next to sympathy flattery is perhaps woman's most effective weapon.  And

No masculine shield there is which woman's flattery will not pierce.  For

Man--man alert in the hunt keen in business circumspect with his
fellows terrible in war man is pristine and simple in matters
emotional and an easy prey to emotional wiles.  In the long journey of
evolution from Amoeba to Man

The masculine sex has developed muscle and mind;

The feminine sex developed and perfected the emotions.  Accordingly

Man's emotions are the primitive weapons of a savage;

Woman's emotions are arms of precision.  Yet

Sometimes woman deplores the unequal contest--perhaps deplores her
too-easy victory.  Since

In domestic life the weapons are laid aside the pair are then
--presumably--unarmed and defenseless.  For though

A mat has to be won by weapons

Marriage should be a treaty of peace: thenceforth the combatants are
allies.

Many a man when ensnared has been amazed at the size of the meshes.

Only a woman knows by what open methods floundering men are captured.

* * *

He who by reasoning thinks to find out woman must either be a
philosopher or a fool--probably both.

Less of a philosopher and more of a fool is he who thinks to extract from
woman her reasons for her actions.  The woman who can give reasons for an
action is yet to be born.  The reason is plain:

Women act upon intuition not upon reason.  And

He who could make a logical sorites out of feminine intuitions could make
a philosophical system out of nautical almanacs.  And yet probably

Could we only determine her orbit a woman's intuitions are as exact as
the paths of the planets.  Unfortunately

Such are the perturbations to which a woman's orbit is exposed that no
masculine astronomy can construct its ephemeris.  Alack
How many anxious star-gazers are there among men! The orbit of the
ordinary male man it is not as difficult for a woman to compute inasmuch
as

The ordinary male man revolves unusually about two foci: his Appetites;
and his Ambitions.--Which is the major and which the minor . . . .
However

You may trust women to know when he is in peri-and when in aphelion.

Many a spouse has no difficulty in explaining away to her lord actions
about the character of which even his initiate friends have no shadow of
doubt.  For

A woman's perception is preternatural.  But no; it is natural enough
since

From the days of the first woman to the days of the New one love its
wiles and its whims has been the serious business of woman.

* * *

Women know much better than men that stolen bread is sweetest.  In
consequence

Men steal almost everything they get from women.--At least they think
they do.  Which is the same thing.

* * *

If the sexes were to change places more marriage licenses would be taken
out.

* * *

'Frailty' says man 'thy name is woman'--and then he takes advantage
of it.

* * *

At arm's length it is difficult to offer a helping hand.  Yet it is
hazardous to reduce that distance.

* * *

Neglect is the unpardonable sin in a woman's eyes.  Woe to the man who is
guilty of it.

* * *

If a woman possessed only a man's tact what fallings-out there would be!

* * *

Man's summum bonum is to combine a comfortable home with congenial club.

Woman's summum bonum is the almost equally incompatible combination of a
well-regulated family and the height of fashionable gaiety.

Man's infinum malum is domestic distraction.
Woman's infinum malum is social exile.

* * *

Between man and man to lay another under pecuniary obligation is to
jeopardize friendship.  Between man and woman a like cause brings about
an opposite result.

* * *

The man with something of the feminine about him often knows better than
his more masculine rivals how to work upon feminine susceptibilities.

* * *

Most women know how much to leave to a man's imagination.--But then
man has not much imagination.  Besides

Man's imagination is always highly complimentary to woman.

* * *

Affinity covereth a multitude of sins.

* * *

To attract sometimes requires temporary repulsion.  But

Some women miscalculate their satellite's orbit.  With the result that
either it rushes on to certain destruction or it passes beyond the
limits of gravitation.

The woman who to one man is no more than the sub-stratum of frock and
bonnet is to another man the centre of gravity of the created cosmos.

When she is such centre to more than one man her horoscope is difficult
to cast.

* * *

When one heart lays siege to another  both sides throw up entrenchments;
and this even when both belligerents are ready to negotiate for
surrender.  But

Never never show that you expect capitulation.  And

Flank movements are not to be recommended.

* * *

In conversation the last thing a woman expects from a man is
information unless it be information concerning himself.  In fact

Talk is a mere subterfuge.  It is what is left unsaid that tells.
Nevertheless

When once the troth has been plighted both M and N try to utter what has
been left unsaid.  But always with indifferent success.  Alack and
well-a-day

Can Love ever say what it feels?

* * *

It is difficult to say to which sex it is a greater compliment that
widows always prove such successful fascinators.  Either they still have
a penchant for mankind despite their intimate acquaintance with him--in
which case the men may congratulate themselves; or else they have so
completely found men out that they find no difficulty in entrapping them
--in which case it is the women's turn to applaud.

* * *

When our feelings are unwittingly hurt by a beautiful woman the pain is
largely tempered by a subtle pleasure which proceeds from a feeling
that inasmuch as we have been undeservedly pained we merit her
sympathy perhaps even her affection.

* * *

Women seek not so much man's esteem as his admiration.  In fact

* * *

Women would rather attract than inspire.--Indeed (by him who dared) it
might be added that

Women would rather be kissed than be sonnetted--which is mighty lucky
for the majority of men!

* * *

The most interesting man or woman is--well perhaps the one most
interested in us.

The least interesting man or woman is--well perhaps the one most
interested in him-or her-self.

* * *

Never fear but that one woman will urge your suit with another (unless
of course that other is a rival); for

Match-making is one of the most fascinating of feminine avocations.

* * *

When a woman allows it to be understood that she considers herself
irresistible to the other sex she draws upon herself the odium of her
own.  By the other sex however such a woman is very differently
regarded.  Indeed

Men regard the avowed coquette not at all with malice but with a very
opposite feeling of which perhaps amusement admiration and a certain
amicable defiance are the chief ingredients.

* * *

It is only mountains that are volcanic or are snow-capped; the plains
know nothing of extremes of frigidity or fire.

* * *

To the woman whom he has ceased to love the man is sometimes
unconsciously cruel.

Towards the man whom she has ceased to love the woman commonly acts a
part.

* * *

For a woman to humiliate one man in the presence of another is an offence
which neither of the men is likely to forget.  Nor will the one man have
a less unpleasant recollection of it than the other.

* * *

It is curious to listen to the explanations by one woman of the reasons
of the attractiveness of another woman.  Very apt is she to say that the
other woman is too free and easy too liberal of her favors too
expansive of her sympathy too exhibitive of her charms.--Ahem!

Women know women.  And

Women know that women know men.  And

Women know that men do not know women.--Ahem!--Men in this respect are
somewhat different:

A man usually regards not ungenerously the qualities of his successful
rival; a woman never.  The former will candidly admit the possession of a
more potent charm; the latter will trace it to the crudest of causes.  In
a word

The unsuccessful man blames not his rival nor the women he loses but
himself.

The unsuccessful woman blames never herself but either the outrageous
meretriciousness of her rival or the blindness of the man she loses.
From which it may once more be deduced that
The unsuccessful woman blames never herself but either the outrageous
meretricousness of her rival or the blindness of the man she loses.
From which it may once more be deduced that
Men are won by more primitive means than are women.  And alas for men
(alas also for many women)

The majority of men are so blind so abominably blind that they cannot
distinguish the women who are really in love with them from the women
who pretend to be in love with them but are not.  For because

So completely do women know men that it is easy for any woman to delude
any man.  This is one of the reasons why

Every woman is the rival of every other woman:

This woman will be herself her own true simple and virtuous self; will
resort to no subterfuge adopt no meretricious methods scorn to rely
upon tactics or strategy be ever reserved reluctant shy;--yet fail.

This other woman will openly and blatantly overtly and unconcernedly
assail the masculine heart with word and look and gesture--and win.
--Ach! the purblindess of the masculine heart! how it exasperates even
the woman!

* * *

That man has sunk low who cannot recognize and respect the remnant of sex
even in a degraded woman.

* * *

Woman can persuade themselves--and men--far more easily than can a man
of the propriety of their actions.

* * *

Man is powerless before an injured woman.  He has no more dangerous foe
than this.

* * *

It is the man who seeks excuses.  The woman braves it out.

* * *

Coquetry is Love's lady's-maid.  She is accessory and ancillary to Love;
she bedizens Love she tricks her out in gay apparel.

When Love's lord and master enters my lady's maid is dismissed.  (It
might be as well sometimes to recall her.) And

Nudity ousts coquetry.

* * *

Chastity is a word with as many shades of meaning as there are peoples
--perhaps as there are individuals--upon the face of this habitable
world.

Women think chastity is a virtue primarily insisted upon and enforced by
men.  They mistake.  'T is a virtue primarily insisted upon and enforced
by women:  For

When that divine unique thing Love comes to a woman if she be not
chaste it is she who deplores the fact.  The man may easily enough be
deceived; her own heart a woman can never deceive. Besides

With what righteous indignation women themselves visit unchastity!

* * *

Between the sexes resentment is the worst of defensive weapons: in the
hands of a man it is like a cow-hide shield opposed to Mauser bullets; in
the hands of a woman like a parasol on a cloudy day.  Since

Woman penetrates resentment by ridicule; man treats it with dull
indifference.  And

A snub from a woman is never forgotten.  And for two reasons: because

(a) The lord of creation hates to be floored by the jiu-jitsu of feminine
raillery; and because

(b) The last thing a man expects from a ministering angel is mundane
mockery.  Besides

Deliberate derision murders not only affection but admiration.

* * *

A blush needs no apologies.  (Why? Because

Always a blush is spontaneous uncontrollable; and

If there is any one thing a man likes to see it is a spontaneous an
uncontrollable action in woman.)

When the man has declared himself hers and hers alone; has given proof of
the truth of such declaration; has bound the woman to himself by terms
dictated by herself then but not till then the woman acts spontaneously
and without control; then she blushes.  But

Seek not impulsive masculine lover to explore too many of the mysteries
of this thy feminine helpmeet.  Perchance she feels herself so much above
thee that she blushes to give the herself.  Perchance she regards thee so
much a symbol of the god-like that she blushes for because she is not
more worthy.  But far more probably she blushes for because she betrays
to thee a mortal a divine and cosmic secret.  For

There is a divine and cosmic secret hidden beneath every blush.

* * *

Ah! man man peccant impulsive passionate man little knowest thou of
the divine and cosmic secret that underlies Love.

To thee O man it may be 't is a momentary flash that irradiates the
world and reveals for a moment a sky above that world;

To thee O woman 't is the reverberating thunder that echoing rolls
for ever after unceasing in thy ears.  Is this why

Between a man and a woman a single look will sometimes change the
complexion of an intimacy of a life-time? And

Not until that look comes--not until eyes look into eyes with a
penetration supernatural--is acquaintanceship metamorphosed into love.

* * *

It is a favorite fiction amongst women that a rejected suitor either will
not marry or marries the first girl he meets.  Because

To marry another woman after having offered inalienable and unalterable
fidelity to one would otherwise be a blow to amour propere. And yet
strangely enough or perhaps not so strangely

This is a fiction but rarely maintained with regard to her own cardiac
transportations.  And for this reason:--

Woman is and knows herself to be a multiple personality;

Man a tyro in emotions is cast in a simpler mould.  So

A woman may donate herself piecemeal or over and over again yet deem
herself perfectly loyal.--And perhaps naturally and legitimately; for

That man who will comprehend and appreciate all the intricacies of
feminine emotion . . . . . . . but there is no such being existent.
Indeed even

Self-revelation is a task no daughter of Eve has achieved.

* * *

To sum up: between men and women

The consummation of love is a bodily oblation the outcome of spiritual
obsession.--Must I explain this?  No I shall not.  Suffice it to say
that

The Heavenly Aphrodite is true friend to the Earthly.(4)  So

Nothing offends love; since love finds in all that savors of the mortal
only a symbol and epitome of the supernatural.  And

There is in Love a cosmic force and secret incomprehensible
incommunicable by man.

Is not after all Love the one supreme and significant fact of the
cosmos: indelible indecipherable: efflorescing in Man; emerging from the
material; idealizing the carnal; pointing to an inscrutable a spiritual
goal? Can it be that

If we could explain Love we should explain the cosmos? What if we could
explain why it is that no one single isolated portion of the cosmos can
live alone--and vaunt itself in itself sufficient--(5) but must seek
some other single and isolated portion of the cosmos in order that that
very cosmos shall continue shall evolve shall go towards its goal . . .
Do we put our finger here upon some curious and recondite cosmic
fact utterly transcending our mean comprehension?

X. On Jealousy

. . . la jalousie . . . monster odieux.
--Moliere


'Ware jealousy as you would 'ware wire: for it no psychiater has yet
discovered a balm.

* * *

To make an experiment of jealousy is to make a very hazardous experiment
indeed.

* * *

Jealousy is no proof of love for

Often jealousy is but rancor under a sense of humiliation.  Indeed

Jealousy is a sign of weakness:

The lover whose self-confidence assures him of his pre-eminence fears no
rival.  Yet

Male self-confidence is peculiarly vulnerable where women be concerned
since

As no man knows what it is appeals to a woman he does not know on what
to pride himself:

Even an Othello is jealous of even an Iago.  Yet

It is only the spectators who see the folly of Othello.
Desdemonas usually are helpless as they are oblivious.

* * *

The illicitly favored lover is never jealous of the husband; but of
another illicitly favored lover how jealous he is.  But

Jealousy like modesty and like virtue varies with every time and
clime: what is customary in Cairo would rouse consternation in Kent and
what goes on in Vienna shocks New England.  So

How the husband favored lover differs also with every time and clime:
here he is mulcted in damages there he is shot down in a third place he
is tolerated.

How the woman thinks her husband should treat the illicitly favored lover
--that you shall never find out.

* * *

The edacity of jealousy is unappeasable:

A wronged lover  in his pain looks for more pain to bear: like a martyr
in an ecstasy he cries out for further tortures.  In love one always
sees higher unreachable heights; in jealousy always deeper unreachable
depths.  And

There is no wound but leaves its cicatrix.

* * *

Mistrust an unexpected change of front.  So

Does your erstwhile frowning lady smile? cherchez l'homme or la femme.
Since

To arouse jealousy in another feminine breast is sometimes the motive of
feminine complaisance.  Indeed

Few women can forgo an opportunity of arousing jealousy whether in a
feminine or in a masculine breast.--Bethink thee of this little fact O
man when next thy lady comports herself thee wards ultra-graciously.

To see the girl of thy heart--even if so be she not thine nor not
nearly thine--comport herself with another as she does with thee--ah!
that gives a twinge to the masculine heart.  Nay lesser things than this
will perturb this irascible organ: that the other should admire her
charms--that she should accept such admiration. . . .. yet what cares
she that these discomfort a man? For

A man's discomfiture is naught to a woman.  In sooth

Take a woman to task for her conduct and with how soft an answer she
will turn away your wrath how deftly make light of your rival's
advances!

* * *

Man when he has won him a woman is in his great greed of possession
infinitely chagrined that he was not master of her past as of her present
and future.--This goes by the name of la jalousie retrospective.

* * *

Women never know quite how to regard a man's jealousy.  It flatters her
yet it pains her.  She is the cause of it yet she would believe it
causeless.  She deplores it yet she would not have it quite away.  It is
proof of love yet it is fatal to love.  How to treat it puzzles her.
Implicit obedience to the man's wishes lowers her in her own eyes and
consequently so she thinks in his.  Yet so rabid is the emotion she
fears to provoke it too far.  It places her in a quandary.  She never
knows what will evoke it; she never knows what course it will run:
whether it will cement her lover's affections or whether it will
dissipate them forever.

It is love's most dangerous foe and it is dangerous because it is
insidious.  If there is any one thing that puts a woman's wits to the
test it is a man's jealousy.

* * *

The sheerest and most insensate folly a man can commit towards a woman is
to let her know that another woman is cognizant of her jealousy of her.
He may give the latter a very keen pleasure; but he gives the former a
very keen pang.  For

The cause of jealousy a woman may condone; the divulgence of her jealousy
she will never forgive.

* * *

What irritates a jealous man is the actions that cause his jealousy;

What irritates a jealous woman is the person who is the cause of her
jealousy.  In other words

A jealous swain upbraids his mistress;

A jealous mistress objurgates her rival.

* * *




XI. On Kisses and Kissing

Sag mir wer einst das Kussen efrund?
Das war ein gluhend glucklicher Mund;
Er kusste und dachte Nichts daberi.
--Heine


Many are the varieties of kisses; as many probably as the varieties of
kisses; as many probably as the variety of lips--and of the owners
thereof.  And

A kiss may mean so very much--or so very little.  Wherefore

Look not upon the lips when they are red;--for although
A kiss is a small thing so is a spark.  And always though

A smile is an open window a kiss is an open door.

Strange--strange--that from the momentary contact of lip with lip an
infinitesimal surface of epithelial tissue there an be called up from
the deeps of the soul emotions strange as deep; emotions vague and
thrilling; emotions to the which to give utterance those lips are
themselves all powerless.  And

When to the conjoined lips there is added the bliss of an up-turned eye
and embracing arms . . . . . Ah! well-a-day

There are Edens for us still if only we will eat not of the forbidden
fruit.

* * *

The value of a kiss is determined by the personage on whom it is
bestowed not by the from whom it is besought: which if it needs any
explanation means this that

It is the man who ardently desires the kiss that puts the value upon that
kiss not the woman of whom it is desired.  Yet women know that

As with commodities so with kissings the greater the rarity the
greater the vale.

Osculatory transactions there be as lasting in their results as transient
in their causes.

* * *

A cheek surreptitiously brushed in the dark is preferable to lips
premittedly pressed by day.

* * *

What an extraordinary multiplicity of maneuvers a man will perform for
Just one kiss! But

With the precise numerical equivalent of the expression Just one kiss
algebra has not yet been found quite able to grapple.  It is believed
however to belong to Permutations and Combinations.

There is a very decided but wholly indefinable line of demarcation
between the kissed and the unkissed woman.  In other words

The status quo ante exosculationem can never be re-established:
hitherto the kisses may have been friends; henceforward they may be. . .
they may be . . . . . . But

Who shall say to what kissing may lead? Besides

Much more kissing than is supposed goes by purchase than by favor.  All
which probably will be Greek to the uninitiated. Nevertheless and at
all times and in all places

A kiss is like faith: it is the evidence of things not seen the
substance of things hoped for.

* * *

How appalling the immensity of the results due to the minutest of causes
--a burning city from a lighted match; a life-long tragedy from a stolen
kiss! In truth

Fate is often another name for Folly.

* * *

A woman who is afraid of a kiss knows much.  Amongst other things
perhaps that

Kisses like misfortunes rarely come singly--and bear many things in
their train.

* * *

Despite the varieties of beards and mustachios never will you hear from
your osculatrix the source of her knowledge of that variety.

If by any chance the divulgence leaks out--how the girl beshrews the
mischance! For though the man may hold his peace she knows that she
gives him to think.

* * *

It takes two to make a quarrel.  Yes: and it takes two to make the
reconciliating kiss.

XII. On Engagements and on Being Engaged

Chalepon to mae philaesai
Chalepon de kai philaesai
--Anacreon.


Perhaps the pleasantest and most satisfactory period in a girl's life is
the time of her first youthful engagement:

Never is a girl more jubilant never more buoyant never so charming so
blithesome or so debonair as when she is the gazetted about-to-be bride
of the man of her girlish choice.  For

During her engagement a girl is owned and petted; and
Ownership and petting are dear to women--whether young or old:

Ownership is proof at all events that she is of value to the man--else
the man would not sought to make her his; and

Petting is proof that the man properly appreciates the value.  Yet
meanwhile anomalous as it may sound

The engaged girl is still her own property and is practically free.
Besides

What more delectable to a girl than to have captured and kept a real man?
This flatters her uplifts her makes of her a woman at once: she holds
her head higher she carries herself with an air; she shows off her
capture. Besides also

The engaged girl is looked up to by her compeers is congratulated y her
elders.  Even if she keeps the engagement secret these compeers and
congratulatresses do not (sometimes alas! To her detriment).--In
addition to all this

What delight so unique as the preparation of the trousseau! 239
Trousseau!--'T is a name of mystical import to man.

A woman's trousseau is symbol of two things--and perhaps dimly indicative
of a third:

(i) it proves--what needs no proof--that such is the unselfish nature
of Love never can it give enough never enhance too much the gifts it
gives.  Accordingly the bride goes to the man appareled and bedecked to
the best of her ability;

(ii) It is a subtle tribute to the sensibility of man of the man in
love who is stimulated and pleased by dainty it may be diaphanous
raiment.  Lastly since even that supernal thing Love is not unconcerned
with matters practical

(iii) It bespeaks as prophetic suspicion of the little fact that perhaps
it is well to go to her husband's home abundantly provided with dainty
raiment inasmuch as the man not in love is not always so delicately
sensible of their need.

* * *

A girl's first engagement is peculiarly sweet: long does she remember
long meditatively dwell upon its pettiest incidents. For if any man
dared give utterance to so outrageous an assumption

The emoluments of a promise to marry are as sweet to the donatress as
undoubtedly they are to the accepter.--And why not pray? Nevertheless

A certain practical sobriety supervenes upon subsequent affairs of the
heart.  For

The recurrence of love is apt to spoil its romance.  And yet--and yet--

It is a question which woman after woman has put herself in vain
whether 't would have been wiser to have accepted and retained the
romantic love of unthinking youth or to have waited for the more sober
affection of the years of discretion.

Perhaps a girl hardly knows all that is meant by that thing called love
or what is entailed upon her by that thing called an engagement.  She
has played with love so much that when a real and serious love is
offered her she still thinks it the toy that amused her.  But

Soon enough does the man if he is earnest--and a man never proposes
unless he is in earnest--enlighten the girl of his choice: for

To a man love never is a toy--though mere lust may be:

Men never play with love as do girls: they play with lust--as they
play with bats and balls and fire-arms;

When men fall in love they fall in love with a vengeance; and

The seriousness with which the man falls in love startles the girl.

The man demands so much; is so exacting' so peremptory; so unyielding; so
frightfully selfish; so terribly jealous of the slightest look or smile
or gesture bestowed upon any other than he that the girl . . . . . .
well the girl probably begins to think either that the man is an
unreasonable brute or that her girlish notions of love were somewhat
astray.  Then one or two things happens: either the man goes off in a
huff; or the girl mends her ways.

* * *

The recurrence of a love is a great shock to love.  Love thinks itself a
think unique unalterable supreme; a thing not made out of the flux and
change of earthly affairs but heaven-born and descended from the skies;
that it should go and come seems to destroy the fundamental conception of
love.

* * *

The affianced man thinks he has won him the sweetest the most sacrosanct
thing that ever trode God's earth outside of Eden: a bundle of blisses a
compact little mass of exquisite mysteries whose every tint and curve
and motion are to him sources of wonderment and delight; he is at once
humbled and exalted; he thanks high Heaven for the gift; for that comport
himself worthy of such gift; for that this wondrous and mysterious little
thing called a woman should of her own accord put herself in his arms
to be by him and by him alone cherished and nurtured till death them do
part--this indeed gives the mail heart a very sobering a very ennobling
thrill; for beneath the heaving breast he so passionately loves behind
the eyes into the depths of which he so passionately looks there stirs
he knows that ineffable that indefinable thing a woman's heart; and
that TO HIM has been committed the keeping of that heart--this rouses in
him the manly virtues as no other thing rouses them.  Strong is the man
who can live up to these emotions; sage the woman who knows what she has
aroused.

* * *

The philanderer or the flirt--to whom love-making and love-taking have
been a pasttime--is appalled at the seriousness of love when real love
is offered him or her.  For often enough

The philanderer or the flirt thinks compliments and cajolery the food of
love: in time they discover that love is a veritable sarcophagus!

* * *

Many an accepted lover (both masculine and feminine) tries to make up for
coldness of passion by warmness of affection: a subterfuge of dubious
efficacy.  For though

Affection seeks affection passion is only appeased by passion.  Yet

When one loves passionately and the other languidly accepts it is well
perhaps for that other sometimes to be a little unfaithful to the truth
(1) and to simulate an unfelt ardor.  But always this is of questionable
value for

Love abhors simulation of anything even of ardor.

(1) Tennyson Love and Duty.

* * *

If mutual confidence is not established at the moment of betrothal it
will never afterwards be established.  And

Woeful will be the plight of those between whom mutual confidence is not
then established.  For

Mutual confidence is the only atmosphere in which love can breathe.

* * *

An engaged man like a hungry man is an irascible man.  And
How often a fiance is sore put to it not only to satisfy him but to
pacify him!

* * *

A woman will often blandly ask why the two rivals to her hand should not
be friends! Yet it is significant of much that she does her utmost to
keep them apart! Indeed

In no instance are a woman's tact and finesse so exercised as in playing
off one man against another.--And yet usually she delights in the task;
for

Being-made-love-to is to women what killing--whether of men or of
animals--is to men.  In a word

To be sought after is to woman what war or the chase is to man.

* * *

The woman a woman accepts a man then and there he becomes her lord and
master.  And this she unconsciously knows--nay expects.  If the man
does not then and there exercise his lordship and show his mastery he
will find it difficult to do it later on.  But of course

No woman will ever be got to admit that her newly-won man is her master.
Nevertheless it is counsel that every man should lay to heart for

Unless a woman is dominated (N.E. not dominated over) she tries to get
the upper hand.  And

Only two instances there are in which the woman should retain the upper
hand: when the man is either a philosopher or a fool;

When a man is both (and the combination is not uncommon) she would be a
fool if she did not retain the upper hand! But

Little does a woman esteem him to does not sway--nay who does not
sacrifice it may be: her to his will.

* * *

Of that engaged pair who can confidingly speak the one t the other of the
dawn of their mutual attraction little need be feared; if they cannot
very much may be feared.  For

Love without confidence is as defunct as faith without works.  For

If M cannot confide in N it probably means that K and L have or that O
and P will.

* * *

So tremendous are the results of the gift of self that Nature herself
seems to have ordained that the feminine sacrifice shall be utter and
complete.  For

A man's interests may be many and and behold a bold girl will appear and
carry off the shy man! Perhaps to the life-long chagrin and sorrow of all
three.

Often oh! how often an awkward and sophisticated youth and a prim maid
with down-cast eyes will sit together waltz together and the one never
get one inch the nearer to the other though soul and mind and body crave
a closer union.  The youth would give the solid earth--nay the solid
earth would be naught--to gain him the courage to clasp the maiden to
his breast; yet so intense his awe he would not strain a spider's web
to risk the maid's good will.--The maid--who shall say what passes in
her mind? That the youth should adventure she could wish; yet his very
hesitancy bespeaks his devotion true.  Were he to fall about her neck
embrace her close and demand the kiss of love--most like she would
recoil aghast--at first! Yet if he desisted--she would also recoil
aghast.--What should he do poor awkward youth? what she?--One thing
onlookers will do: smile and simper and smile again; but in their
inmost heart of hearts they will envy that awkward youth that simple
maid.  For because in this the first symptoms of unsolicited and
reciprocal love they will recognize something of the divine and mystical
nature of Love itself of Love untrammeled by convention or law; of Love
itself in its purity its intensity its diffidence its terrifying yet
restraining force.

Ah! Love not in every conflict art thou victor crowned. (2)

XIII. On Marriage and Married Life

ariston andri ktaema sympathaes gunae.
--Hippothoon


Marriage laws are framed not for or by the likes and dislikes of men and
women but by the exigencies of social often of political economy.
Therefore

Men and women's likes and dislikes are obliged to conform to the usages
demanded by social and political economy: so

In Turkey women accept with a good grace the custom of a plurality of
wives; in Tibet men accept with good grace a plurality of husbands.  In
the western world .. . . Humph!

Always will there be everywhere prevalent a latent hostility between the
likes and dislikes of men and women on one hand and the laws enforced by
a social and political community on the other.  This is why

Always there will be those who will try to reform the marriage state:
some looking only to the likes and dislikes of men and women others only
to the advantages which shall accrue to the State.  So

Some there will be will always advocate a loosening of the marriage bond
others who will seek to make it indissoluble.  Both should remember that

The unit of the State is the family; therefore the State makes laws not
to suit the tastes or convenience of the husband and the wife but for
the good and preservation of the family.  All of which surely is right
and proper since

It is the business of the State to make laws governing the welfare of the
generations to come.  In fine

The children--they are the pivot about which all matrimonial
controversies should turn.

Reformers of marriage laws should seek a preventative not a cure; since

It is doubtful whether the ills of matrimony are really curable for
generally speaking

Matrimonial incompatibility is a malignant not a benignant disease; its
prognosis is doubtful; nor does it run a regular course.

* * *

Many are the women who soon after marriage silently turn over in their
minds this little problem: whether it were better to marry the man they
loved but who did not love them; or to marry the man who loved them but
to whom they were indifferent.  And

The man a woman ultimately marries will give her no clue to the solution.
And for the following reasons:

(i) He fond wight does not know that any such problem is agitating her
little brain; and

(ii) She of course dare not divulge the factors of the problem. In
short

Most marriages are brought about by the following simple yet fateful
consideration: The man marries the woman he wants; the woman marries the
man who wants her.  The two propositions though apparently identical
often produce results very far from identical.  And yet

Sometimes--sometimes--that glorious dream comes true in which a hale
and heart-whole youth implants the first pure passionate kiss upon the
lips of a hale and heart-whole girl.--Ah happy twain! For them the sun
shines the great earth spins and constellations shed their selectest
influence.  'T is a dream that all youth dreams.  'T is a dream makes
wakeful life worth living.

Ah! the wild dream of youth! The maenad dream! The spring-time dream!

Of the maid: the dim dim dream of stalwart man offering a love supreme
without alloy and taking forceful a love as flawless as supreme; a
steady breast on which to lean strong circling arms a face set firm
against the world a face that softens only to her up-turned eyes that
seek the lover who is hers and hers alone; a dream of music color and
the swaying dance; of rivals splendidly out-shone; of home and friends
and trappings; of raiment. Retinue; of ordered bliss; and by and by in a
still dimmer far-off time a time un-whispered to herself of
baby-fingers baby lips . . . . . .

Of the youthful man: a vivid dream involved unsteady shifting; a dream
of lust and love and smoke and flame and fame; of cuirass and horse and
saber; of blood  and battle; of high place;  of many dominated by his
look and gesture; of mighty man and orders issued preemptory not to be
gain said; also of lithe arms a supple waist sweetly-soft entwining
limbs a gentle girlish woman all his own who never was another's and
always will be his; and an heir and household gods.--Ah! the wild dream
of youth!

Youths dream ye while ye may! And you ye aged I charge ye do not wake
them: it is the dream makes wakeful life worth living.  And yet--and
yet

Sometimes--sometimes alack and fie for shame things come to such a
pass between husband and wife that a modus viviendi has to be tacitly
agreed upon.  In that case alas!

Too often between husband and wife it depends upon who is the better
actor and liar--to their shame be it said.  But before this happens
much else must have happened.  For

Here and there ahem! we meet a woman who is like the moon: she circles
sedately round and dutifully faces the planet to which she is united;
but that planet does not know that she is irradiated and warmed by a
far-distant sun--a sun which symbolizes ahem! Duty or Necessity or
Affection for her children or (tell it not in Gath) Affection for
another.

And here and there ahem! we meet a man who like the sun shines
steadfastly enough upon his own earth but shines also all unbeknown to
earth upon other earths--and errant comets--and small aerolites.

* * *

As it is usually physical or sentimental characteristics that bring a man
and a woman into the field of mutual attraction so it is generally
physical or sentimental characteristics that drag them apart.  Thus

A clever wife will put up with a stupid husband and an intellectual man
will get on admirably with a dull but domestic woman.  But

If either party to the marriage contract disregards or is unable to
appease the demands made upon him or her for sympathy or emotion there
is likely to be trouble; for

Sentiment not intellect is the cementing material in marriage and

If a man and wife cannot effuse a mutual sentiment gradually they will
grow apart.  Indeed

The demands of the emotions are at once more imperious and tyrannical
and more fastidious and critical than are the demands of the mind.  Of
all of which what is the moral?  This:

The married pair who would live in amity not to say in affection must
so live as that each shall persuade the other is the sole personage under
the roof of heaven that he or she desires.  Alas!

The unwritten motto of many a married couple is: The Heart Knoweth its
own Bitterness.

* * *

Marriage reveals the moods of a man.

What is an ideal marriage? That perhaps in which the man is to the woman
at once friend husband and lover.  But some people prefer these
functions distinct.

That is a happy marriage in which a woman's husband is also her
confidant. And always

Husband and wife should move like binary stars: revolving about a common
centre; mutually attractive; and unless closely viewed presenting a
single impression.

* * *

Matrimony is sometimes a terrible iconoclast.  Whether it throws down the
images of false or of true gods depends on the religion of the
worshipper.

* * *

It would be difficult sometimes to determine whether constancy was an
autogenous or enforced virtue.

* * *

Never play pranks with your wife your horse or your razor.

* * *

There is a thing which not gold nor favor nor even love can buy.  Its
true name is secret; but it is content to be called Sympathy.
Accordingly

Let no man or woman think when he or she has won wife or husband all has
been won that is necessary.  For

If sympathy cannot be gained from one quarter it will probably be sought
in another.

* * *

At the moment of the formation of a matrimonial syndicate of two each
member of this as yet unincorporated joint-stock company verily believes
that each has put into the concern his whole real and personal property.
Yet it is to be feared that although

The woman possibly invests her whole capital the man--often no
doubt unwittingly to himself--retains not a few unmatured bonds and
debentures.  That is to say

Love it is to be feared is often enough a bargain in which the woman
comes off second-best.  For

A woman gives herself; man accepts the gift.

Rarely if ever does a man give himself.  He cannot.  His work his
play his politics his friends his club--these are matters to him
highly important.

To a woman the only highly important things are: her husband and her
home.

* * *

A woman rules until she tries to rule--which will be an enigma to many.


Out of a wife's obedience will grow her governance; never out of her
dominance.--Those who think this sheer nonsense are welcome to think
so.  But it is worth thinking about.

* * *

A man ought to rule his wife.  Granted.  But he cannot do this unless he
rules himself.  The Colonel of a Regiment cannot command if he himself
breaks the King's or the State's Regulations.  And

An uncontrolled wife deems her husband indifferent--or weak.
The number of husbands who though they think they rule yet in reality
are ruled  would astonish--not their wives but themselves.

It is customary to call the man the head of the household; yet between
man and wife it is a question after all whether it is not the stronger
will and the cooler judgment that should and generally does guide the
family independent of sex or custom.

* * *

As in the solar spectrum so in love: beyond and intermingled with the
visible rays of passion are numerous actinic but invisible rays of
affection invisible to careless spectators but known and felt by the
recipients.  These too must be introduced if the connubial domicile is
to be warmed as well as illuminated.

* * *

The marriage tie loosens all other ties.  In fact

Neither men or women are always aware of the absoluteness of the marriage
tie: thenceforward the woman belongs not to her own people hardly to
herself.--As to the man well

Often a wife will actually be jealous of the time and attention her
husband spends on things and matters unconnected with her--his work
--his play--his politics--his friends--his club.

* * *

Many are there who still believe that the marriage service like a legal
indenture irrevocably entails the whole estate of a human heart.  In
sober truth

There never was a married couple yet who had not to purchase their own
happiness.  And

The only charms that increase in value as time goes on are the charms of
character; beside these those of person and even those of mind are
weak.  In short

In marriage as in every human relationship it is character that avails
and prevails naught else.

* * *

Chemists draw a distinction between a chemical and a mechanical mixture.
Moralists might discover the same in marriage.

* * *

To encircle monogamy with an ever-increasing halo of romance--that is a
problem deserving of study.

Monogamy is one of the disharmonies of life; it seems (as I have said) to
be the decree of politics rather than of nature.

But surely polygamy or polyandry would be more disharmonious still.

* * *

Marriage renders no one immune.  That is to say;

Unless husband and wife both avoid infection both can catch amatory
fevers.

* * *

The woman who has learned how to minister to a man's creature comforts
has learned much.  And

It has disconcerted many a young wife to discover how important a part of
her education this is! Since

It is certainly sometimes hard to reconcile a suitor's poetic
protestations with a spouse's prosaic requisitions.

* * *

In the game of life a man may venture many stakes; a woman's fate is
determined by a single throw of the dice.  Thus

How often it happens that a young and inexperienced maid will look about
her will weigh and consider will pick and choose and when she thinks
she has found a man to her purpose will set her cap at him will attract
him enslave him bring him to her feet make him propose accept him as
husband give him all the sweets of engagement regard herself and
proclaim herself his affianced bride--all with most prudential--it may
be most praise-worthy--motives.  On a sudden the man discovers that
this was no real attachment but a fictitious almost an enforced one;
that the methods (so he thinks) were artificial the results delusive.
What happens? The man withdraws--politely--gallantly: t'was a mistake;
he is sorry; they are unsuited; he did not know his own mind; he is
sorry;--and so on and so forth.  They separate.  And in this
concatenation of circumstances action for breach of promise is out of
the question.--Besides often enough the girl through pride or
through sheer chagrin at the indifference of the man pretends
acquiescence.--What happens to the man? Nothing.  If his senses were
stirred he himself is heart-whole.  He gave nothing; he merely received.
He proposes again to somebody else; is accepted; marries happily; rears a
family. What happens to the girl? Everything.  The man gave her nothing;
she gave all--her lips her looks the recesses of her heart; the
premonitions of the gift of her self; for when she leant on him looked
up to him clung to him felt his strong encircling arms was perturbed
by his ardor she gave that which was not to give again.  Such woman is
to be pitied.  For however much she may strive to make it appear that
she gave nothing that she had all to give again not even her own soul
will bear her witness and sooner or later a subsequent lover (and such
girl accepts the first lover that offers) will find a void where he hoped
to find an inexhaustible treasure.  For the woman cannot forever keep up
a fictitious affection; and languid looks and eyes that will not
brighten and smiles which are so evidently forced bespeak her
sympathies elsewhere.--But as Heine said this is an old story often
repeated. (1)  Wherefore

Let us pity women! The dice they throw are their hearts--and they have
only one throw:--when they have thrown away their hearts--Pity women!

Men have so many dice to throw: income status title; virility fortune
fame; good spirits good connections good looks; an air a figure a
soul-stirring voice; manners breeding force; a good name a good bank
account.  The pity o' it is that

The whole marriage question revolves about a single point:

The man wants him a woman--a woman who shall be his and only his;

The woman wants her a head of a home.  And here again and once again we
see the difference between the sexes:--

The one thing that the man wants is: a mate;

The one thing that a woman wants is: a head and provider of a
household.

The man's thoughts never go beyond the woman;

The woman's thoughts always and at once travel far beyond the man--to
the children the household the home. This is great Nature's inexorable
law.  But little knows the woman and less knows the man that the nubile
girl is merely obeying great Nature's inexorable law.

What price woman pays for her high office! for in this implicit
unquestioning and unconscious obedience to Nature she performs perhaps
her highest function.  On all accounts therefore let us

Pity women! They obey so faithfully great Nature's law and Nature  so
often plays them false--so very false and so very often.  Besides

The woman who gives her hand without her heart finds in time that she has
made a sorry bargain--a sorrier bargain perhaps that the woman who
gives her heart with out her hand.  For

Passionately as a man desires a woman the passionately-desired woman
will in time discover that unless she gives her heart with her hand her
gift suffers depreciation.  And

Unless a woman gives her heart how can she give her aid? Surely

Unless a man's armor is buckled on for the strife of life by feminine
sympathy the fight is apt to be a sorry one at best; since

A woman's true business is to back her husband: if SHE leaves him in the
lurch there is little hope for him.  For of a truth

The strongest man is handicapped in the struggle for existence unless he
knows and feels that his wife is at his side--not pushing him so much as
leaning upon him.

(1)
    Ein Jungling leibt ein Madchen
    Die hat einen Andern erwahlt;
    Der Andre leibt eine Andre
    Und hat sich mit Dieser vermahlt.
    Das Madchen heirathet aus Arger
    Den ersten besten Mann
    Der ihr in den Weg gelaufen;
    Der Jungling ist ubel dran.
    Es ist alte Geschichte
    Doch bleibt sie immer neu;
    Und wem sie just passieret
    Dem bricht das Herz entzwei.
  --Buch der Lieder 39.

* * *

To simulate passion for an hour is possible; to simulate a life-long
love--that is hard.  For

Love is a thing unique and unalterable (in spite of its various alloys);
clip the coin and it will not pass current.  For

Ideal matrimony is founded on a mono-metallic basis: no amount of silver
will be accepted for gold.  And yet

How often M loves and N accepts the love! Poor M! Also (in the long run)
poor N!

That indeed is a happy marriage where M gives and wants just what N
wants and gives: where M and N just want each other.  For

Give and take is the rule of a community of two as it is of a community
of ten thousand;

The ideal (and probably impossible) industrial community is that in which
demand and supply are in exact equipoise.  The same holds good in
matrimony.

In wedlock a virtuous has probably less force than a vicious example.
That is to say

A frivolous spouse is more apt to drag the couple down than is a serious
spouse apt to lead the couple up. And

Many a mate there is (both masculine and feminine) feels like a pack-mule
treading a precipitous pass.

* * *

Of every Audrey her Touchstone should be able proudly to say A poor. .
. . Thing Sir but mine own.  In other words

The homely violet deserves as tender cherishing as the rare exotic.

* * *

What portion of himself or herself any one complicated physical and
psychological human being really and truly 'conveys' to another by means
of the simple contract known as the plighted troth or that of a larger
deed called the called the solemnization of matrimony is a riddle
difficult of solution; and as to how much one may claim on the strength
of one or other of these indentures that is a more difficult problem
still.

In no amatorial contract probably is it possible to include or to
enumerate all the hereditaments messuages or appurtenances involved.
Certainly

How great so ever the community of interest M and N remain for ever M
and N.

Is there not always something in the eternal feminine which cannot
quite coalesce with the ephemeral masculine? Probably

Trust your wife with your purse and seven times out of ten it will grow
heavy.

* * *

Many a woman by man is accepted at her face value.

Many a man by woman is taken on trust.  It is difficult to tell whether

More bad debts are contracted by giving credit than by taking at face
value.  For

The promissory note of marriage is undated and unendorsed.  But

Children act as collateral security.

* * *

How often a girl even an affianced girl accustomed to a multiplicity of
admirers forgets the man of her ultimate choice she must then and there
set above all other claimants!

If the man the woman chooses for husband does not stand in her estimation
absolutely first and all other claimants nowhere there is bound sooner or
later to be trouble.  For

No man will play second fiddle to any body or any thing; and

The realm amatory is a monarchial not a republican one.  In all realms
there must be a ruler whether elected or hereditary.

Always a divided sway results in schism whether in the family or in the
state.  And although

Often enough the wife proves herself the more effective Sovereign the
forms of monarchy must be conceded to the man even though the executive
is left to the woman.

* * *

How often the only breast to which one can go on to rain out the heavy
mist of tears is the one inhibited!

* * *

Two wills are not so easily blended into one as that the task may be left
to Cupid.  Yet

Unless Cupid has a hand in blending two wills it is bound to be a sorry
business at best.

Always and in all wedlock there comes a time when will conflicts with
will.

If both wills are inflexible one must break--or both will fly apart.
But

Love and tact will relieve many a strain.  Though sometimes one discovers
that

Human eyes have a certain store of tears.  It is not difficult to weep
them all away.  However

In the final rupture between man and wife it is the children that turn
the scales.  But O ye young husbands and wives remember that

Youth regards the whole world as its friend; age finds itself desolate in
the midst of friends.  Wherefore

O youth cleave unto the wife of thy bosom; since

A loving wife is worth a multitude of friends.

Sweet are friends and fame is sweet; but sweeter far a wifely heart
whereon to lay a weary head.  But

Each married pair must solve its own difficulties as best it can.  If any
advice were worth the offering it would be this:

O ye Husbands and O ye Wives if not for your own sakes then for your
children's lead a straight clean honorable life; any other sort of
life leads to despicability to dismalness to disaster.--Which only
means after all that

In the marriage relation as in every relation--the social the
industrial the commercial the political--it is conduct it is
character that counts nothing else;

Beauty--Wealth--Culture--Grace--Wit--Intellect--Sprightliness--
Vivacity--Humor--these are much but they are simply naught and less
than naught when just this simple single yet insatiable thing called
Man wants to live amicably affectionately martially with that simple
single but incomprehensible thing called Woman.

Character--Conduct--rule the world the Matrimonial equally with the
Municipal.

XIV. On this Human Heart

The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked; who can
know it?
--Holy Writ


It does not take much to make two hearts beat faster than one.

* * *

The heart can deceive itself when it cannot deceive another.--Which
will be cold comfort to some lovers though it may console others.

* * *

To admit a sacred visitant into the inner recesses of the human heart
those recesses must be neat indeed.  Remember too that you can

Never expect an angel to act as a charwoman; the sweeping must be done by
the owner.  Lastly

Unless each heart is permitted access to the other their union is
fictitious perhaps perilous.--Explain these tropes who can.

* * *

No man can tell to whom a woman's heart belongs; not even the man who
calls the woman his.  And

Let no man imagine that when he has won him a woman he has won him a
woman's heart.  Since

Sometimes a woman will give her heart to one man and her troth to
another.  Besides

Many a heart is hard to read--especially if it is a palimpsest.  Indeed
many are illegible to their owners.  Nevertheless
That the woman should not know her own heart (as so often happens)
terrifies the woman as much as it exasperates the man.  Yet

That must be a curious love that causes the heart to hesitate.  And yet

Many a man has debated for months whether to propose or not; and
sometimes a woman will accept on a Friday the man that she refused
point-blank of a Tuesday.  But perhaps

Where the heart hesitates it is not so much a case of love as a case of
convenience.  For

An overwhelming love leaves the heart of either doubt or debate.  But
alas

The human heart seems to be an anatomical engine of such intricate and
delicate mechanism that its workings are uncontrollable even by its
owner.

Is a constant heart as hard a thing to manufacture in the world of life
as is an immobile thing in the world of matter? And matter so they say
is immobile only at absolute zero--when bereft of even molecular motion:
a thing impossible to produce and which to produce would require
incalculable pressure and almost incalculable cold.

(Is there no chemical formula for fixing the impression of the heart?)

Who really held Burns his heart in thrall Nelly Fitzpatrick or Mary
Campbell or Ellison Begbie or Margaret Chalmers or Charlotte Hamilton or
Jenny Cruikshank or Anne Park or Jean Armour or Mrs. Whelpdale or Mrs.
Agnes McLehose? and who the heart of Goethe--Gretchen or Kitty Shonkopf
or Frederica Brion or Charlotte Buff or Lily Shonemann or the Countess
Augusta or Charlotte van Stein or Bettina Brentano or Mariana von
Willemer--or his wife Christina Vulpius?

However whether it is a provision of Nature or whether it is due to the
perversity of Man probably the feminine heart is far more constant than
the masculine and perhaps any one of Goethe's or of Burns his inamoratas
would have clung to him had he been faithful to her.  And yet

Would you have had Shelley stick to Harriet Westbrooke? and how shall one
interpret his feelings for Amelia Viviani?  What would have happened if
Keats had lived and married Fanny Brawne--she who flirted with somebody
else while he was sick and did not even know that he was a poet? Yet she
was an inspiration to Keats as Mary Godwin (and Amelia Viviani) were to
Shelley (1). Ought Byron to have said 'No' to Claire or Lady Caroline
Lamb or the Countess Guiccioli or any one of the many maids and matrons
that besieged his heart? Could anything have kept Rosina Wheeler and
Bulwer Lytton side by side--Rosina Wheeler to whom before marriage
Lytton could find write Oh my dear Rose! Where shall I find words to
express my love for you? and to whom after marriage he wrote Madam
The more I consider your conduct and your letter the more unwarrantable
they appear?

God in heaven! what a pitiful game it all is! And alas! as George Sand
says All this you see is a game that we are playing but our heart
and life are the stakes and that has an aspect which is not always
pleasing. (2)

Epipsychidion).

(2) Letter to Alfred de Musset.

* * *

Many a man's heart has been treated as a football.  Yes; but many a
woman's heart has been treated as a shuttlecock.

* * *

Human beings there are--both men and women--out of whom at a mere
touch virtue seems to go: converse with them is stimulating; contact
enthralling.  And yet

Powerful as physical or as mental attraction may be permanently to
retain the attracted object requires a profounder force.  Perhaps
though

Beauty and grace and brilliancy may attract; it is only something far
more deep-seated that retains.  In other words

Charm of body and mind may appeal to body and mind; only the heart
appeals to the heart.  Those who know not this and they are

Many permit the heart to leak through the senses; with the result that
when demands are made upon the heart that cistern is found to have run
dry.  So

To philanderers and to flirts when a great and true love comes they do
not comprehend it and they cannot appreciate it. Wherefore

Would-be lover keep thy heart intact until it be required of thee.

* * *

You need not imagine that because you have once been permitted to see
some way down into a human heart that you will necessarily ever again be
so permitted.

* * *

Hard words break no bones.  But they often break hearts.

* * *

Drink is too often the refuge of the masculine and a rich husband the
refuge of the feminine broken heart.

* * *

Extreme youth thinks the world is a toyshop--where anything may be had
for the asking; old age regards it as a museum--where nothing may be
touched.

* * *

No heart under repeated temperings can remain forever keen.  And

As a little body sometimes has a very big pain; so an aching heart
wonders that it can bear so much.   And

What takes place in the quiet deeps of a troubled heart who shall know?

* * *

The way to the heart is not through the head:

Between heart and heart there are many channels.  But three are in
universal use: the eyes the lips and the finger-tips.  Now the
greatest of these is the eyes.

* * *

The masculine heart will never wholly understand the feminine nor the
feminine the masculine. (O the pity o' it!) And yet after all

The human heart is much more the same whether it beats under a cuirass
or under a corset.

Between the masculine heart and the feminine perfect frankness is
perhaps of questionable import.  But why? It is difficult to say.
Perhaps because

The aspirations and desires of the human heart are infinite and
unappeasable.  To attempt to formulate them is to frustrate them.  For

It is as impossible for any two human hearts  as it is impossible for
any two material things to occupy the same space.  Especially when we
remember that

Between the masculine heart and the feminine is a great gulf fixed.  Nay
rather

From youth to age each human heart seems unwittingly to build about
itself a high and ever higher-growing wall impenetrable indelapidable
not to be scaled by the look or speech or gesture.
Never can heart coalesce with heart.  And yet

The absolute and intimate coalescence of heart with heart--is not this
after all the consummation that every lover seeks? To attempt that
consummation by mere speech it is this that is of questionable import.
Since

Between heart and heart speech is the paltriest of channels.

What a thin--yet what an invisible and impenetrable--film separates
those two worlds: the one that of the visible audible and tangible
the world of chatter and laughter of convention often of make-believe;
and the other the world of deep and voiceless emotions of the feelings
which know not how to give themselves utterance of affections which
crave so much and are so impotent to say or to seek what they crave! It
is like a layer of ice separating the hidden and soundless deeps from the
aerial world of noise and motion.--What would not one heart give to
break the icy crust and see and know what was really passing in another?
--And how often we drown if we do break through!

The isolation of the individual human heart is complete.  It is the most
pathetic past in the universe and it is that against which the
individual human heart rebels most.

There must be some profound and cosmic problem underlying this fact which
no philosophy--and no religion--can solve.  That it is pathetic seems
to prove it temporary earthly a matter of time and space;  but when
will the individual human heart coalesce with the Heart of the Universe--
which perhaps is the goal of all Life? For

It may be that these little terrestrial human individuals which we call
men and women are after all only tiny and temporary centers of conscious
activity in an ocean of infinite consciousness; as atoms are but tiny and
temporary centers of energy in an ocean of infinite ether.  Could we see
the sum total of Supreme and Infinite Consciousness at a glance perhaps
individual men and women would dissolve into a mighty unity could see
and comprehend the whole of the luminiferous ether.  Well perhaps

Love is the only known means by which the individual heart can make any
expansion whatsoever beyond its own bounds.  Yet alas!
Nothing seems to break down the barriers of sense.  The human heart beats
its ineffectual wings in vain against the walls of its fleshly
tabernacle.  Will nothing unite the Boy and the Girl? Will nothing bring
the Man and the Woman really together? Yet the Boy thinks that were the
Girl wholly his he and she would be happy; and the Man thinks that were
the Woman and he to share every thought and every emotion he and she
would want naught else.  Is the amalgamation impossible? Is the
coalescence of thought and feeling outside the bounds of human
possibility? What then impels mankind to crave it to attempt it to
sacrifice so much for it?--There is a cosmic puzzle here with which nor
philosophy nor psychology nor religion has yet attempted to grapple.

After all pitiful as it may be lamentable as it may be it is true and
it must be said that this human heart of ours goes through life hungry
very hungry and unappeased.   For what it hungers what it has missed
whereto it looks for sustenance it itself does not know.  Thus

This feminine heart sighs without ceasing for because that other
masculine heart upon which it staked all its all and an all that meant
so much proved callous and indifferent;

That masculine heart ceases not to curse itself for resorting to such
hasty and violent methods by which to obtain for itself an ephemeral and
passing pleasure;

This feminine heart eats out its life with remorse for because it gave
itself so unthinkingly when asked;  though of a survey it thought that
asking was a thing prompted by impulses as noble as they seemed divine;
and

That masculine heart when the tidal wave of heated passion has subsided
wonders how it was led captive by lures so deceptive and untried.

M regrets and regrets in vain that he did not await a purer and more
permanent passion; and

N chews for a life-time the cud of persistent remorse for an hour's
poignant pleasure.

Ach! this human heart knows nothing of itself nor anything of its fellow
beating hearts.  If it follows its bent it is cracked; if it holds
itself in leash it aches.  If it calls reason to aid its soaring hopes
are dashed its romance spoiled and it itself reduced to the level of a
machine that calculates.  If it acts on impulse and meeting a heart that
beats so it thinks in unison unites itself with it often enough that
other soon palpitates to a different rhythm or itself cannot keep time
and all things go awry.

Poor aching beating human heart! It cannot reason; it cannot count the
cost.  To it seems that impulse divine and mighty impulse is the sole
law of the earth; in time it learns that impulse the mightiest the
divinest though it may be law in heaven is sometimes a veritable
nemesis on earth: it gives freely gladly without compunction; it finds
the gift rewarded by consequences too pitiful for tears.

Alas this human heart! Can no one advise it Is there no advice will help
it? Must it always go wrong and always suffer?--Well
--If one loves one dare not reason; if one reasons it is difficult to
love.

* * *

There seems to be something cosmic something transcending the bounds of
the visible and tangible universe in the desires and cravings of this
same human heart; this little human heart beating blindly beneath a
waistcoat or a blouse.  Its owner is little bigger than a beetle or an
ant and the habitat of that owner is a speck in space; a pygmy in
comparison with Sirius or Arcturus and invisible from the
ultra-telescopic confines of vision.

What it makes the desires and cravings of this human heart more
important more importunate to its owner than the measuring of the
vastest space? Why is it that the longings the hopes the
disappointments the desperate aspirations and the passionate loves of
little human hearts should cause to their possessors such prepotent
commotions such poignant qualms? Rigel and Betelgeuse and Algol rush
through space and about them probably circle numerous planets inhabited
by countless and curious beings each and all perhaps possessing hearts
as perturbable as our own.  And yet if our own little earthly Jack
cannot get our own little earthly Jill what cares Jack what happens to
Vega or Capella or to the great nebula in Orion? Jack wants Jill; and
that want is to Jack the only thing in the sidereal heavens that matters.

The curious and perhaps semi-comical but wholly-pathetic thing about the
whole matter is this: that though undoubtedly our little planet is part
of and has a place in this great sidereal universe and consequently all
our Jacks and Jills are related to all the Jacks and Jills everywhere
else yet each little human heart behaves as it were the only heart in
the sum-total of created things: if it enjoys it calls upon all that is
to congratulate it; if it suffers it cries aloud to high heaven to
avenge its wrongs: it comports itself as if it and it alone were the only
sensitive things in existence.--That is curious.  That it wrongs may
have been wrought by itself; that is fate may have been determined in the
reign of Chaos and Old Night or ere even cosmic nebulae were born it
does not dream: if Jill is indifferent or Jack morose--either is enough
to cause Jack or Jill to curse God and die.  Is there some archetypal and
arcanal secret in this the extreme the supernal egoism of the human
heart?

Of all of which what is the moral?--Humph! Frankly I do not know what
is the moral.  Only this I see: that each little heart creates its own
little universe: the bee's the that of its hive and the fields; man's
that of his earth and the stars.  What may be above or beyond the stars
man no more knows than the bee knows what is beyond the fields.  The
heart--be it man's or a bee's--is the centre of its self-made sphere.
Some day perhaps man's sphere will extend as far beyond the stars as
today it extends beyond the fields.  Then--who knows?--perhaps
unlimited senses and an uncircumcised intellect may find themselves
commensurate with this high-aspiring heart and an emancipated and
ecstatic Jack unite with a congenial Jill.

That there is a Universe is apparent; that it is one and complete we
suppose; that there are in it Jacks and Jills is indubitable; that these
Jacks and Jills crave mutual support sympathy love friendship
wifehood sistership companionship brotherhood is also indubitable.
If therefore the whole scheme of the Universe is not a farce what does
this craving of Love for Lover mean? And yet

It is quite impossible to conceive of a Universe of Love in which all
the claims of Heart and Soul and Senses shall be eternally and infinitely
satisfied? Nevertheless on this little earth perhaps

Ill betides the heart that leans overmuch on another. For alas!
Not even the entire immolation of one heart for another will satisfy that
other.--Indeed indeed

In this life would one seek comfort and solace one must seek it--in
one's own self or in one's God.  For

Only one of two things can comfort: To put the world under one's feet;
or to keep a God over one's head: only

He who is captain of his soul or he who commits his soul to God can
rise above fate.

There is a vacuum in every human heart.  And the human heart abhors it as
much as nature.

What will fill this cardiac void no mortal to this moment has found out.
Art cries Beauty and tries to depict it; Philosophy cries Truth
and strives to define it; Religion cries Good and does its best to
embody it; and numberless lesser voices in the wilderness cry Power
or Gold or Work--which is a narcotic or Excitement--which is
an intoxicant; and a many-toned changeful siren with sweetly-saddening
music cries Love.  And one pursues a phantom and another clasps a
shadow and a third cloaks his eyes with a transparent veil or steeps
his senses in floods that will not drown.--No what the human heart
wants it does not know.  And what is more

Pathetic problem amongst problems pathetic often it puzzles this human
heart to distinguish between the things which it is right and proper to
seek wherewith to fill that void and the things which are wrong and
improper.  Furthermore:

How apt is the heart to seek in the illegitimate for the satisfaction
which the legitimate fails to give!--Problems ancient as Eden.

What does it want this human heart what does it so earnestly desire so
strenuously seek? All about it and about are beauty friendship mirth
and gladness; the sea and the earth and the sky; color and music and
song; and to each if he wills it wife or husband and children and
home.--Wanting is--what?--Ah!

One lesson this human heart has to learn so easy to put into words so
difficult to carry out by deed; is this:

To get the human heart must give.

The heart eats out itself; causes its own emptiness; creates its own
void.

The selfish and egoistical life breeds always the vapid and vacuous
heart.

Would you appease your own hunger? Feed the hungry hearts around you.

Do you crave fullness of joy? Give joy to the joyless.

Would you fill your own cavity satisfy your craving attain your desire
find what you seek? Give--give--give.  The more the better for

The greater the donation the greater the repletion.

Nature gives gives lavishly wantonly unquestioningly.

Every atom of soil every drop of sap goes to produce flowers and fruit
and seed: root and branch and leaf are but carefully constructed means by
which to transmute sunshine and soil and flower and fruit and seed.  No
tree lives for itself.

Shall then this human heart live for itself; gather and store up for
its own delectation for its own good?

There is no such thing as one's own good:

Goodness is mutual is communal; is only guided by giving and receiving.
Wherefore

O frail weak human heart seek thou out carefully constructed means by
which to transmute sunshine and soil and showers into flowers and fruit.
